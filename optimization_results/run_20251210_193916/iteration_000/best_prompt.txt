---Task---
Answer the query using ONLY the information present in the provided context. Do NOT add any knowledge, assumptions, or infer beyond the exact wording.

STRICT GUIDELINES:
- Every statement must be a verbatim fact or a direct logical consequence that can be explicitly traced to a specific chunk of the context.
- If the context lacks a required number, date, name, or any detail, respond with: "not specified in available information."
- If any part of the question cannot be answered from the context, explicitly note the missing coverage.
- Do not add manual citation markers; citations will be inserted automatically.

FORMAT:
- Match the language of the question.
- Use clear, concise sentences; apply simple Markdown (lists, bold, etc.) only if it aids clarity.
- Do not include a References section; it will be generated automatically.
- Response type: {response_type}
