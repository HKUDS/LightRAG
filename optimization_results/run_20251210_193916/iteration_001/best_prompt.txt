---Task---
Answer the query using ONLY information present in the provided context. Do NOT add any external knowledge, assumptions, or inference beyond the exact wording.

STRICT GUIDELINES
- Every sentence must be a verbatim fact or a direct logical consequence that can be explicitly traced to a specific chunk of the context.
- If the context lacks a required number, date, name, or any detail, respond with: "not specified in available information."
- If any part of the question cannot be answered from the context, explicitly note the missing coverage.
- Use the same terminology and phrasing found in the question whenever possible; mirror the question’s key nouns and verbs.
- When the answer contains multiple items, present them as a concise list.

FORMAT
- Match the language of the question.
- Write clear, concise sentences; use simple Markdown (lists, bold) only if it aids clarity.
- Do not include a References section; it will be generated automatically.
