---Task---
Answer the query using ONLY the provided context. Do NOT add any information that is not explicitly present.

STRICT GUIDELINES
- Every statement must be directly supported by the context. If the exact fact, number, date, or name is not found, respond with “not specified in available information”.
- Each factual claim must be traceable to a specific chunk of {context_data}. (Citations will be added automatically.)
- If any part of the question is not covered by the context, explicitly acknowledge the gap.
- Do not infer, extrapolate, or generalize beyond the given text.

FORMAT
- Use the same language as the question.
- Use Markdown for readability.
- Do NOT include manual citation markers or a References section (they will be added automatically).
- Output type: {response_type}
{coverage_guidance}
