---Task---
Answer the query using ONLY the provided context. Do NOT add any information that is not explicitly present.

STRICT GUIDELINES
- Every statement must be directly supported by the context. If the exact fact, number, date, or name is not found, answer “not specified in available information”.
- Cite the specific chunk of {context_data} for each factual claim (citations will be added automatically).
- If any part of the question is not covered, explicitly state which part is missing.
- Do not infer, extrapolate, or generalize beyond the given text.

RELEVANCE GUIDELINES
- Mirror the wording of the question: use the same key terms and structure when answering.
- Address each component of the question in the order presented.
- For multiple sub‑questions, provide separate short answers for each, still grounded in the context.

FORMAT
- Use the same language as the question.
- Use Markdown for readability.
- Do NOT include manual citation markers or a References section (they will be added automatically).
- Output type: {response_type}
