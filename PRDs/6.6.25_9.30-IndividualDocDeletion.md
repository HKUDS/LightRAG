# PRD: Individual and Batch Document Deletion for LightRAG WebUI

## 1. Executive Summary

### Overview
Implement selective document deletion functionality in the LightRAG WebUI to allow users to delete individual documents or multiple documents in batches, complementing the existing "clear all documents" feature.

### Goals
- Enable granular document management with individual deletion
- Provide efficient batch deletion for multiple documents
- Maintain data integrity through proper relationship cleanup
- Ensure user safety with appropriate confirmation mechanisms
- Follow existing UI/UX patterns and code architecture

### Success Metrics
- Users can successfully delete individual documents
- Batch selection and deletion works for multiple documents
- Zero data corruption incidents
- Positive user feedback on document management workflow

## 2. Background & Problem Statement

### Current State
- Users can only delete ALL documents at once via "Clear Documents"
- No way to remove specific unwanted or outdated documents
- Backend infrastructure exists (`adelete_by_doc_id`) but isn't exposed in UI
- Document management lacks granular control

### Problem
- Users need to manage documents individually without losing entire knowledge base
- No way to clean up failed, duplicate, or irrelevant documents selectively
- Workflow inefficiency when only specific documents need removal

### User Pain Points
- Can't remove test documents without clearing everything
- Unable to delete failed or corrupted documents individually
- Must rebuild entire knowledge base to remove unwanted content

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

#### Core Features
1. **Individual Document Deletion**
   - Delete button for each document row
   - Confirmation dialog before deletion
   - Real-time UI updates after deletion
   - Error handling and user feedback

2. **Batch Document Selection**
   - Checkbox for each document row
   - "Select All" / "Deselect All" functionality
   - Selected count indicator
   - Batch delete button (only visible when documents selected)

3. **Safety & Confirmation**
   - Individual deletion: Simple confirmation dialog
   - Batch deletion: Typed confirmation (similar to clear all)
   - Warning about potential impact on knowledge graph
   - Ability to cancel operations

4. **Status Integration**
   - Respect pipeline busy state (disable during processing)
   - Update document counts after deletion
   - Refresh document list automatically

#### API Requirements
1. **Individual Deletion Endpoint**
   - `DELETE /documents/{doc_id}`
   - Response with success/error status
   - Proper error codes and messages

2. **Batch Deletion Endpoint**
   - `DELETE /documents/batch`
   - Request body with array of document IDs
   - Response with detailed results (success/failed per document)

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Batch operations should be efficient (parallel processing where possible)
- UI should remain responsive during deletion operations
- Real-time progress feedback for batch operations

#### Security
- API authentication using existing auth system
- Input validation for document IDs
- Rate limiting for batch operations

#### Usability
- Consistent with existing UI patterns
- Clear visual feedback for destructive actions
- Accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Mobile-responsive design

## 4. Technical Specification

### 4.1 Backend Implementation

#### New API Endpoints

```python
# In lightrag/api/routers/document_routes.py

@router.delete(
    "/{doc_id}",
    response_model=DeleteDocumentResponse,
    dependencies=[Depends(combined_auth)]
)
async def delete_document(doc_id: str):
    """Delete a specific document by ID"""

@router.delete(
    "/batch",
    response_model=BatchDeleteResponse,
    dependencies=[Depends(combined_auth)]
)
async def delete_documents_batch(request: BatchDeleteRequest):
    """Delete multiple documents by IDs"""
```

#### Request/Response Models

```python
class DeleteDocumentResponse(BaseModel):
    status: Literal["success", "not_found", "busy", "error"]
    message: str
    doc_id: str

class BatchDeleteRequest(BaseModel):
    doc_ids: list[str] = Field(min_items=1, max_items=100)

class BatchDeleteResponse(BaseModel):
    overall_status: Literal["success", "partial_success", "failure"]
    message: str
    results: list[DeleteDocumentResponse]
    deleted_count: int
    failed_count: int
```

### 4.2 Frontend Implementation

#### Component Structure
```
DocumentManager.tsx (existing)
├── DocumentTable.tsx (new - extracted from existing table)
│   ├── DocumentRow.tsx (new)
│   │   ├── DocumentCheckbox.tsx (new)
│   │   └── DeleteDocumentButton.tsx (new)
│   └── BatchActionsBar.tsx (new)
├── DeleteDocumentDialog.tsx (new)
├── BatchDeleteDialog.tsx (new)
└── ClearDocumentsDialog.tsx (existing)
```

#### State Management
```typescript
// Add to DocumentManager state
const [selectedDocs, setSelectedDocs] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())
const [isDeleting, setIsDeleting] = useState(false)
const [deleteProgress, setDeleteProgress] = useState<{
  total: number;
  completed: number;
  current?: string;
}>()
```

#### Key Components

**DocumentRow Component**
```typescript
interface DocumentRowProps {
  doc: DocStatusResponse;
  isSelected: boolean;
  onSelect: (docId: string, selected: boolean) => void;
  onDelete: (docId: string) => void;
  disabled: boolean;
}
```

**BatchActionsBar Component**
```typescript
interface BatchActionsBarProps {
  selectedCount: number;
  totalCount: number;
  onSelectAll: () => void;
  onDeselectAll: () => void;
  onDeleteSelected: () => void;
  disabled: boolean;
}
```

### 4.3 API Integration

#### Service Functions
```typescript
// In api/lightrag.ts
export const deleteDocument = async (docId: string): Promise<DeleteDocumentResponse> => {
  return (await apiClient.delete(`/documents/${docId}`)).data;
};

export const deleteDocumentsBatch = async (docIds: string[]): Promise<BatchDeleteResponse> => {
  return (await apiClient.delete('/documents/batch', { data: { doc_ids: docIds } })).data;
};
```

## 5. User Experience Design

### 5.1 UI Layout Changes

#### Document Table Enhancement
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Documents                                    [Clear All] [Upload] │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [X] Select All (5)                     [🗑 Delete Selected (3)]  │ <- New batch bar
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ☐ Document 1  │ Summary... │ Status │ ... │ [🗑]               │ <- Checkboxes + delete buttons
│ ☑ Document 2  │ Summary... │ Status │ ... │ [🗑]               │
│ ☑ Document 3  │ Summary... │ Status │ ... │ [🗑]               │
│ ☐ Document 4  │ Summary... │ Status │ ... │ [🗑]               │
│ ☑ Document 5  │ Summary... │ Status │ ... │ [🗑]               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop**: Full table with checkboxes and individual delete buttons
- **Tablet**: Compact table, swipe actions for delete
- **Mobile**: Card layout with selection mode toggle

### 5.2 User Flows

#### Individual Document Deletion
1. User clicks delete button (🗑) on document row
2. Confirmation dialog appears: "Delete document 'filename'?"
3. User confirms → Document deleted → Table updates → Success toast
4. User cancels → Dialog closes, no action

#### Batch Document Deletion
1. User selects documents via checkboxes
2. Batch actions bar appears showing count
3. User clicks "Delete Selected (N)"
4. Batch delete dialog appears with typed confirmation
5. User types "DELETE" to confirm
6. Progress indicator shows deletion status
7. Results dialog shows success/failure summary
8. Table refreshes with remaining documents

#### Error Handling
- **Individual Delete Errors**: Toast notification with error message
- **Batch Delete Errors**: Detailed results dialog showing which succeeded/failed
- **Network Errors**: Retry option with exponential backoff
- **Pipeline Busy**: Disable delete actions, show status message

### 5.3 Confirmation Dialogs

#### Individual Delete Dialog
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Delete Document                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Are you sure you want to delete     │
│ "document-name.pdf"?                │
│                                     │
│ This will also remove related       │
│ entities and relationships.         │
│                                     │
│ [Cancel]              [Delete] 🔴   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Batch Delete Dialog
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Delete Multiple Documents           │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ You're about to delete 5 documents: │
│                                     │
│ • document1.pdf                     │
│ • document2.txt                     │
│ • ... and 3 more                    │
│                                     │
│ Type DELETE to confirm:             │
│ [________________]                  │
│                                     │
│ [Cancel]              [Delete] 🔴   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 7. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risks
1. **Data Loss from Accidental Deletion**
   - *Mitigation*: Strong confirmation mechanisms, undo functionality consideration

2. **Performance Issues with Large Batch Operations**
   - *Mitigation*: Batch size limits, progress indicators, background processing

3. **Knowledge Graph Corruption**
   - *Mitigation*: Leverage existing `adelete_by_doc_id` logic, comprehensive testing

### Medium Risks
1. **UI Complexity**
   - *Mitigation*: Progressive disclosure, clear visual hierarchy

2. **API Rate Limiting**
   - *Mitigation*: Client-side queuing, retry mechanisms

### Low Risks
1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - *Mitigation*: Follow existing patterns, test on supported browsers

## 8. Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- **Undo Functionality**: Soft delete with recovery period
- **Advanced Filtering**: Delete by status, date range, or content type
- **Bulk Import/Export**: CSV-based document management
- **Audit Trail**: Track who deleted what and when
- **Preview Mode**: Show what will be deleted before confirmation

### Technical Debt
- Consider refactoring existing DocumentManager for better separation of concerns
- Evaluate state management solution for complex selection states
- Plan for eventual migration to more sophisticated document versioning

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

### Individual Deletion
- [ ] User can delete any single document from the table
- [ ] Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
- [ ] Document disappears from table immediately after deletion
- [ ] Success/error feedback is provided
- [ ] Related entities/relationships are properly cleaned up

### Batch Deletion
- [ ] User can select multiple documents via checkboxes
- [ ] Batch actions bar appears when documents are selected
- [ ] Batch delete requires typed confirmation
- [ ] Progress is shown during batch operations
- [ ] Detailed results are provided after completion
- [ ] Partial failures are handled gracefully

### General
- [ ] All deletion operations respect pipeline busy state
- [ ] Document counts update correctly after deletions
- [ ] API endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] UI remains responsive during operations
- [ ] Feature works consistently across supported browsers
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met

This PRD provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing selective document deletion while maintaining the quality and consistency of the existing LightRAG WebUI.
