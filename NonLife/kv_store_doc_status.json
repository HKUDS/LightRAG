has contributed significantly to the development of risk management tools and\nprocesses, in insurance, pensions and related industries. Actuarial skills are also increasingly being\napplied in new and developing areas of knowledge.\nActuarial practice continues to improve the understanding, measurement and communication of risk\nand risk events and their implications through the development of tools and increasingly processes to\nmanage the future uncertainty of risks in a sustainable and transparent way. These tools and processes\ntrace, manage and mitigate the acceptance and transmission of the uncertain outcomes of risks.\nThe Risk Book is intended to provide high-quality reference materials to support a better understanding\nof the risks and inherently uncertain future outcomes that need to be managed when delivering financial\nservices products â whether they involve insurance, investments or retirement incomes, or more\nbroadly. The Risk Book is written to be accessible to a wide range of readers, many of whom may not\nbe actuaries or experts in the areas discussed but may be decision-makers in those areas.\nConsequently, the Risk Book should provide insight into the ideas and concepts behind actuarial topics\nand concepts. It is therefore focused on being descriptive rather than being formal and mathematically\nprecise.\nAll the Risk Book chapters are publicly available on the IAA website and are periodically updated. See\nwww.actuaries.org and follow the path to Publications and then to Risk Book. A discussion of their\nstructure and relationships is provided in the chapter Introduction â Using the Risk Book.\nThe Risk Book is intended to be a dynamic and evolving resource, updated over time, reflecting new\nareas where actuarial expertise can add value, experience and advances, and topics of current interest\nand importance. It is electronically distributed to support ongoing updates. Risk Book chapters will be\nreviewed periodically at least every five years, and more frequently if significant changes or\ndevelopments occur.\nThe development and maintenance of the Risk Book is managed by the Risk Book Editorial Board of the\nIAA Insurance Regulation Committee.\nMany people, mostly actuaries, have contributed to the Risk Book. Contributors are listed on the website.\nTo submit comments or questions about this Risk Book chapter, or to report any problems with the\nwebsite, please email riskbookcomments@actuaries.org.

Non-life insurance is all types of\ninsurance except life insurance, annuities and pension obligations. It includes general insurance\n(examples are motor/auto, property, business interruption, liability, workersâ compensation,\nemployment practices, homeowners/residential, accident, travel, event, and natural\ndisaster/catastrophe), health insurance, short-term disability insurance, long-term disability insurance,\nsurety, credit insurance, mortgage insurance, and others.1 This chapter also covers methods other than\ninsurance for managing the financial and some non-financial losses associated with non-life perils.\nBecause non-life insurance is such a broad category, this chapter focuses on the most common types\nof non-life insurance. Some types go by different names in different countries, so the focus is on peril\nand insurance coverage descriptions more than the specific names.\nThere is a related IAA Risk Book chapter, Liabilities for General Insurance.\n\n\n1.2 Purpose of This Chapter\nThe purpose of this chapter is to cover basic information concerning non-life perils and insurance\ncoverages that:\n     ï·    Consumers, companies, and other entities may need to know when considering non-life risks\n          and how to handle them;\n     ï·    Insurers and reinsurers may need to know when considering non-life risks and whether to insure\n          them; and\n     ï·    Stakeholders may need to know when reviewing insurance and reinsurance policies.\n\n\n1.3 Chapter Approach\nThere are many aspects of non-life perils and coverages that differ from those of life insurance,\nannuities, and pension obligations. This chapter starts with the basic concepts of perils, hazards, and\nexposures and explains frequency and severity, risk management, risk control, and risk financing\n(Section 2). It focuses primarily on risks that can be insured, even though a person or entity may choose\nto manage risk through use of risk financing techniques other than insurance or a combination of\nseveral risk management techniques.\nThere are several ways to categorize risk, including pure versus speculative risks. Risk categorization is\nimportant because pure risks, such as damage caused by a wildfire, can be insured, and speculative\nrisks, such as gambling, usually cannot be insured (Section 3). This chapter also discusses the other\naspects needed for non-life perils to be insurable (Section 4).\n\n\n1\n    In some jurisdictions, accident insurance, health insurance, short-term disability insurance, and long-term\n    disability insurance may be offered by life or health insurance companies.\n\n                                                       2\n\f                                                                                             IAA Risk Book\n                                                                            Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\nThe types of non-life insurance (Section 5) and their general characteristics (Section 6) are discussed,\nas are the key components of the non-life insurance contract (Section 7). This chapter also discusses\nother issues in non-life insurance that are different from those that arise regarding life insurance,\nannuities and pension obligations, or are the same but have different characteristics (Section 8).\n\n\n1.4 Relevance to Actuaries\nActuaries are involved with assessing non-life perils to:\n    ï·    Determine the appropriate risk financing approach or approaches;\n    ï·    Price those options; and\n    ï·    Set reserves for the financial statements of entities that:\n         o   Retain the financial consequences of non-life losses; or\n         o   Accept a transfer of risk for losses arising from non-life perils from another entity.\nInsurers are an example of entities that accept such a transfer of risk.\n\n\n2       Non-Life Perils and How to Manage Them\nA âperilâ is the cause of loss, such as fire. A âhazardâ is a condition that increases the probability of a\nloss, such as a fireplace in a wooden house or a structure being made of wood instead of concrete\nincreasing the probability of a fire loss.\n\n\n2.1 Exposure\nâExposureâ refers to the state of being subject to a possible loss from one or more perils. A building\nmay have loss from fire and other forms of destruction, such as a hurricane. An âexposure unitâ is a unit\nof measure that is correlated with the exposure to loss. Examples of exposure units are number of\nvehicles for a commercial motor/auto policy, square footage or sales for a retail storeâs general liability\ninsurance, consulting income for consultantsâ errors and omission insurance, and property value for\nproperty insurance.\n\n\n2.2 Frequency and Severity of Claims\nTwo of the primary differences between non-life claims and life insurance, annuity, or pension\nobligations are the concepts of frequency and severity.\n    ï·    Frequency: This is the number of claims or occurrences per exposure unit. In life insurance,\n         there is only one claim on an individual life insurance policy when the insured dies. For annuities,\n         there is only one annuity paid for each insured in each policy year. In pension obligations, there\n         is only one pension obligation per person. Group policies for life insurance, annuities, and\n         pension obligations exist, but coverage still is limited to one claim per covered person. In non-\n         life insurance there can be no claims or more than one claim or occurrence per person or per\n         policy within a policy period.\n\n\n\n                                                     3\n\f                                                                                                 IAA Risk Book\n                                                                                Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\n      ï·    Severity: This is the size of the claim or occurrence.2 In life insurance, annuities and pension\n           obligations, there are defined amounts or formulae that determine the amount to be paid. In\n           non-life insurance, the size of the claim or occurrence is determined by the damage to or loss\n           of value of the items covered by the insurance or, in the case of parametric insurance, by a set\n           value if a predetermined event occurs, regardless of the amount of the actual loss of value.\n           There can be partial losses, such as when a fire damages part but not all of a building. The loss\n           may include allocated loss adjustment expenses, which are the costs of handling the particular\n           claim, such as outside investigation fees and expert witness testimony costs, but do not include\n           the overhead cost of claim handling. The loss also may include other items, such as interest on\n           losses that accrues after a judgment has been made until the insurer pays the awarded loss.\n           Losses paid by an insurer may be reduced by deductibles, limits, or other policy provisions.\n\n\n2.3 Risk Management\nâRiskâ in this chapter refers to the possibility of loss. The word âriskâ has other meanings in other\ncontexts including âthe subject of insurance,â âan insured event,â and âuncertainty arising from the\npossible outcomes of given events.â âRiskâ may also include the possibility of gain, although that\ngenerally is not insurable (discussed further below).\nThere are many ways to manage risk. The two general categories are risk control and risk financing.\n\n\n2.4 Risk Control\nRisk control is a set of methods designed to minimize the frequency or reduce the severity of losses to\nmake them more predictable. These actions can be undertaken by either the entity that is the possible\nsubject of losses or the insurer in regard to its own risk.\nRisk control options are:\n      ï·    Avoidance;\n      ï·    Loss control;\n      ï·    Segregation of losses; and\n      ï·    Contractual transfer of legal and financial responsibility.\nAvoidance eliminates any possibility of loss by not undertaking an activity nor owning an asset that\ncould be the subject of loss. For example, a shipper might choose not to sail ships through the Gulf of\nMexico during hurricane season.\nLoss control has two components: loss prevention and loss reduction. Loss prevention activities\nattempt to reduce the frequency of loss. Loss reduction activities attempt to reduce the severity of\nlosses that do occur. For example, to prevent losses, a shipper might review wind forecasts before or\nduring a voyage and change a shipâs course accordingly. A shipper also might have plans to mitigate\nthe damage from a wind event that occurs mid-voyage to reduce any loss that occurs. Some non-life\ninsurance policies include loss control help as a service that benefits both the insured and the insurer.\n\n2\n    See Section 6.11 for an explanation of the difference between âclaimâ and âoccurrence.â\n\n                                                         4\n\f                                                                                                 IAA Risk Book\n                                                                                Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\nSegregation of losses means arranging assets and activities so that no one event is likely to cause loss\nto all of them. This can be achieved by separating assets and activities into different locations or by\nduplicating assets and activities so that the secondary ones can continue if the primary ones are the\nsubject of a loss. For example, a shipper may split a large shipment of cargo and have it carried by\nmultiple ships, so that if the cargo on one ship is damaged, only part of the cargo is lost. A shipper might\nalso have multiple ports to service ships, so that if one port is damaged, the ships can be serviced at\nanother port.\nContractual transfer of legal and financial responsibility for loss often is achieved in lease agreements\nand subcontracting through contract wording that makes it clear that both the legal and financial\nresponsibility for loss are being transferred. A ship owner may lease its hold capacity to the entity\nshipping the cargo and specify in the leasing agreement that any cargo loss is the legal and financial\nresponsibility of the entity shipping the cargo. This contractually transfers the cost of any loss from the\nship owner to the entity shipping the cargo.\n\n\n2.5 Risk Financing\nRisk financing options are ways to generate funds to pay for losses that do occur. The two primary types\nof risk financing are risk retention and risk transfer.\nRisk retention, also sometimes called âself-insurance,â means drawing on oneâs own funds to pay for\nlosses. This can be achieved through current expensing of losses, using a funded or unfunded loss\nreserve, borrowing, or using an affiliated captive insurer.3\nRisk transfer means transferring the financial, but not the legal, responsibility for the payment of loss.\nThe entity to which the risk transfer is made can be an insurer (or reinsurer) or another type of entity. A\nrisk transfer to an insurer is achieved by an insurance contract. A risk transfer to another type of entity\nis achieved through a statement in a legal contract that requires one party to the contract to accept the\nfinancial responsibility for any injury or damage suffered by another party as a result of the activities to\nwhich the contract applies. For example, a rental agreement may require the tenant to pay for losses to\nthe ownerâs and other rentersâ property from fire damage caused by the renterâs negligence. If the entity\nto which the risk is transferred cannot or will not meet its financial obligation to pay for a loss, the\noriginal entity must make other arrangements for payment because it retained the legal responsibility\nto do so.\nIn addition, some jurisdictions allow pooling arrangements in which individuals or multiple entities pool\ntheir funds and pay for losses from those funds. Depending on the jurisdiction and specific legal form,\nthese are sometimes known as group self-insurance, reciprocal insurance companies, or reciprocal\ninsurance exchanges. These organizations spread the cost of losses among the participants so that no\none individual or entity bears the entire cost of its own losses, may have lower total cost than if each\nindividual or individual entity purchased insurance, and may provide coverages not available in the\ninsurance market.\n\n\n\n3\n    A captive insurer is a licensed insurance company owned and controlled by its insured(s).\n\n                                                         5\n\f                                                                                           IAA Risk Book\n                                                                          Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\n2.6 Combination of Risk Management Techniques\nMany perils are handled through a combination of risk management techniques. For example, fire\nrequires fuel, heat, and oxygen. Take away any one component, and there cannot be a fire. This means\nfire can be avoided by making sure there is nothing that will burn. This might work for part of a factory,\nbut not another part. For the other part, fire loss prevention may be achieved by reducing the amount of\nflammable material available, and fire loss reduction may be achieved by installing a sprinkler system\nand training employees in the use of firefighting equipment.\nIt may be possible to have two smaller factories producing the same product that are sufficiently distant\nfrom each other so that the chance of both of them being the subject of the same fire is essentially\nzero. Or it might make more sense to have two factories producing different products that are\nsufficiently distant from each other so that the chance of both of them being the subject of the same\nfire is essentially zero. If one factory suffers a fire loss, the second factory could split its production\nbetween its original product and the product of the factory that is damaged.\nIn addition to these risk control activities, the organization could decide to purchase fire insurance and\nretain the first $50,000 of each fire loss event. By having a $50,000 deductible that the organization can\nafford to pay, the organization reduces the premium it pays for the insurance it does purchase as\ncompared with what the premium would be with no or a lower deductible.\n\n\n3       Categories of Risks\nThree ways in which risks can be categorized include:\n    ï·    Pure versus speculative risks;\n    ï·    First-party, third-party, and financial risks; and\n    ï·    Fundamental versus particular risks.\n\n\n3.1 Pure versus Speculative Risks\nPure risks are risks that present the opportunity for loss but no opportunity for gain. The outcome of\npure risk is loss if an event occurs or no loss if an event does not occur. Natural disasters such as\nwildfires and floods are examples of pure risk. Pure risks often are managed with insurance.\nSpeculative risks, such as gambling, are risks that are assumed voluntarily and have the potential for\nboth loss and gain. Speculative risks traditionally have not been handled through insurance.\n\n\n3.2 First-Party, Third-Party, and Financial Risks\nFirst-party risks are the risks of loss faced by the person or entity purchasing the insurance. Third-party\nrisks are the risks of loss to someone or some entity other than the insured that are allegedly or actually\nthe financial responsibility of the insured.\nFinancial risks are the possibilities of losing or gaining money on an investment or business venture.\nMarket risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk are types of financial risk. Financial risks are not typically\n\n\n                                                       6\n\f                                                                                             IAA Risk Book\n                                                                            Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\ninsured because they are speculative in nature. However, there are some types of insurance, such as\ntrade credit and political risk insurance, in some jurisdictions that provide some protection for financial\nrisk of loss. The financial risks that are retained can be limited in other ways, such as through use of\noptions for market and currency risks.\n\n\n3.3 Fundamental versus Particular Risks\nFundamental risks are risks that affect entire societies or a large group of people. Natural disasters,\npandemics, and war are examples of fundamental risks. Some fundamental risks, such as natural\ndisasters, can be insured. Others, such as war, generally cannot be insured due to the difficulty of\nestimating the possible losses and inability of the insurer to collect enough premium from insureds to\nprevent the insurer from becoming insolvent in the event of losses. Consequently, war and other\nfundamental risks that are considered generally uninsurable are excluded from most non-life insurance\npolicies. There are some specialty insurance policies that provide limited coverage for these risks. In\naddition, governments sometimes decide that insurance coverage should be available for these risks\nfor public policy reasons and finance these through taxation or other levies (discussed further in Section\n8.4).\nParticular risks are risks that affect an individual or a single entity. Most particular risks that are not\nspeculative can be insured.\n\n\n4       Insurability of Non-Life Perils\nNon-life perils are often insurable only if several requirements are met:\n    ï·     Pure risk: The loss must be from a pure, not speculative, risk.\n    ï·     Large number of similar exposure units: There must be a large number of similar exposure\n          units so that losses can be predicted with reasonable accuracy.\n    ï·     Definite loss: The loss must be quantifiable and definite as to time and place.\n    ï·     Accidental loss: The event that results in the loss must be uncertain in nature and outside of\n          the control of the insured.\n    ï·     Not subject to moral hazard: Moral hazard is a conscious change in behaviour to benefit from\n          an event that occurs. An example of moral hazard is intentionally burning down a building to\n          obtain the insurance proceeds from the loss.\n    ï·     Not subject to morale hazard: Morale hazard is an unconscious change in behavior that\n          increases the probability or severity of loss. An example of morale hazard is to unconsciously\n          be less careful about fire prevention because the building is insured.\n    ï·     Limited possibility of catastrophic loss: Ideally, insurable losses are independent and non-\n          catastrophic. For a particular insurer, the losses need to be sufficiently independent that there\n          will not be a large number of policies with claims at the same time. For example, writing the fire\n          policies for all the buildings on the same block may not be an insurable risk, but writing a policy\n          for only one building on each of multiple blocks may be an insurable risk. Some risks may not\n          be insurable on a single-insurer basis but might be insurable on an industry-wide basis.\n\n                                                      7\n\f                                                                                             IAA Risk Book\n                                                                            Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\n         Catastrophic losses can be insured and are discussed in the Catastrophe Risk chapter of the\n         IAA Risk Book.\nIn addition to financial losses, which usually meet the definite loss requirement, insurance also may\ncover non-financial losses, which usually do not meet the definite loss requirement. Non-financial\nlosses that are insured in some jurisdictions include:\n    ï·    Pain;\n    ï·    Suffering;\n    ï·    Inconvenience;\n    ï·    Emotional distress; and\n    ï·    Loss of society and companionship.\nThere may be situations in which not all of these criteria are satisfied or are not fully satisfied, but where\nenough of these criteria are satisfied that a financial product may be developed and labelled as\ninsurance.\n\n\n5       Types of Non-Life Insurance\nThis section discusses some typical types of non-life insurance. It is not an exhaustive list of existing\ntypes of non-life insurance, and new insurance products continue to emerge.\nNon-life insurance contracts define the obligations of the insured and the insurer. These contracts often\nare split into two groups of insurance: personal lines and commercial lines. Personal lines insurance\npays for losses individuals cannot or do not want to pay for themselves. Commercial lines insurance\nprotects businesses by paying losses they cannot pay for themselves or that they could afford to pay\nbut that would unacceptably disrupt cash flow or earnings.\n\n\n5.1 First-Party\nThere are many types of losses that insureds themselves face, including:\n    ï·    Property (both buildings and contents);\n    ï·    Motor/auto physical damage;\n    ï·    Crime;\n    ï·    Boiler and machinery (discussed further below);\n    ï·    Business interruption;\n    ï·    Event cancellation;\n    ï·    Warranty;\n    ï·    Legal expense;\n    ï·    Pet;\n    ï·    Accident;\n    ï·    Travel;\n\n\n                                                      8\n\f                                                                                              IAA Risk Book\n                                                                             Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\n   ï·    Credit;\n   ï·    Health;\n   ï·    Short-term disability;\n   ï·    Longer-term disability;\n   ï·    Crop/agriculture;\n   ï·    Title; and\n   ï·    War and terrorism.\nInsurance coverages that provide reimbursement for these losses are called âfirst-party coverages.â\n\n\n5.2 Third-Party\nThere also are losses to someone or some entity other than the insured for which the insured allegedly\nor has financial responsibility. The main types of third-party insurance are:\n   ï·    General liability;\n   ï·    Auto bodily injury and auto third-party property damage liability;\n   ï·    Employersâ liability;\n   ï·    Product liability;\n   ï·    Employment practices liability;\n   ï·    Professional liability, which is sometimes called errors and omissions; and\n   ï·    Directorsâ and officersâ errors and omissions.\n\n\n5.3 Other Types of Non-Life Insurance\nThere are some types of non-life insurance that do not fit into the first-party/third-party categorization.\n   ï·    Workersâ compensation: In the United States and some other countries, workersâ compensation\n        systems are designed to avoid requiring the worker to sue their employer to be compensated\n        for a work-related injury. The worker on the job gives up the right to sue the employer for\n        negligence in exchange for the immediate, guaranteed payment of medical expenses and lost\n        wages. Workersâ compensation insurance is purchased by the employer with the workers\n        injured on the job benefiting from the loss payments.\n   ï·    Unemployment insurance: Unemployment insurance provides payments to unemployed but\n        employable people. Loss payments, also called âbenefits,â are often funded by and paid for\n        through a compulsory government system. There frequently are conditions for receiving\n        payment, such as registering with the appropriate government office and actively seeking\n        employment. In some jurisdictions unemployment insurance that provides coverage for certain\n        workers, such as senior executives, may be purchased from an insurer.\n   ï·    Mortgage insurance: A mortgage lender may require the borrower to purchase mortgage\n        insurance. This insurance pays the lender if the borrower is unable to make its mortgage\n        payments or otherwise meet its contractual obligations of the mortgage, such as purchasing\n        property insurance or paying property taxes.\n\n                                                     9\n\f                                                                                              IAA Risk Book\n                                                                             Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\n   ï·    Surety: Surety bonds are a promise by one party to another party that a third party will meet its\n        obligations, usually in construction or finance. Surety bonds are a type of insurance with three\n        parties:\n        o    The principal â the primary party who will perform the contractual obligation;\n        o    The obligee â the party who is the recipient of an obligation; and\n        o    The surety (also called the âguarantorâ) â the party who assures the obligee that the\n             principal will meet its obligations.\n        The insurer that issues the surety bond is the surety. In some countries, surety bonds can be\n        issued by banks.\n        An example should make this more clear. A builder (the principal) purchases a surety bond from\n        an insurer (the surety) that guarantees that the builder will complete a specific project by a\n        specific time for the builderâs client (the obligee). If the builder is unable to meet this obligation,\n        the insurer may pay the obligee to have the outstanding work completed by a different\n        contractor or may choose to take over the construction project itself. In either case, the insurer\n        is entitled to try to recover its loss from the principal.\n        In some jurisdictions, the surety bond is issued for a portion of the project cost. If the principal\n        fails to perform, the surety pays the bond amount to the obligee and walks away. In these\n        situations, surety may be treated as a form of credit insurance.\n   ï·    Financial risk insurance: Financial risk, which is speculative, is typically not the subject of\n        insurance. However, the possibility of loss from financial risk can be insured in certain\n        situations in some jurisdictions. Trade credit and political risk insurance are examples of\n        financial risk insurance.\n\n\n5.4 Single-Line versus Multiple-Line Insurance Policies\nSome insurance policies cover multiple perils that include both first- and third-party losses. These are\nreferred to as âmultiple-lineâ insurance policies. Single-line policies cover one type of risk, such as\nproducts liability.\nThe most common types of multiple-line policies are:\n   ï·    Homeowners/residential;\n   ï·    Commercial multiple-peril;\n   ï·    Cyber;\n   ï·    Motor/automobile;\n   ï·    Ocean marine; and\n   ï·    Aviation.\nHomeowners/residential policies typically cover the first-party losses of physical damage to the\nstructure and contents of the home, and third-party losses if someone not living in the home is injured\non the property. Homeowners/residential policies also may cover the expenses of mitigating a loss,\n\n\n\n                                                     10\n\f                                                                                                    IAA Risk Book\n                                                                                   Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\nsuch as putting plywood over windows broken by a storm, and the cost of another place to live while\nthe damaged home is uninhabitable.\nCommercial multiple-peril policies typically cover: the first-party losses of physical damage to the\nstructure and contents of a business; and third-party losses if someone who is not employed at the\nbusiness is injured on the property. Commercial multiple-peril policies also may cover the expenses of\nmitigating a loss and of opening in a temporary location while the business property is being repaired\nor rebuilt. Commercial multiple-peril policies may provide business interruption coverage that pays for\nlost income while a business is shut down due to loss from an insured peril.\nCyber insurance can include both first- and third-party coverages. First-party coverages may include\ndata recovery and ransomware payments. There may also be third-party coverage for release of\npersonal information of the firmâs clients by a hacker.\nMotor/auto policies typically cover:\n      ï·    Physical damage for the first-party losses to the vehicle itself; and\n      ï·    The third-party losses if other people, vehicles or property are damaged in an accident involving\n           the insured driver if the insured driver is determined to be at fault.4\nIn some jurisdictions motor/auto policies also provide personal injury protection or âno-faultâ coverage\nfor losses to the driver and passengers of the insured driverâs vehicle regardless of who is at fault.\nOcean marine insurance policies cover the first-party losses to vessels used on water and the third-\nparty losses of the damage to the property of others as a result of operating the vessel.\nAviation policies cover the first-party losses to the insured aircraft and the third-party losses of the\ndamage to other aircraft, airports, hangars, and other land-based equipment, as well as liability claims\nfrom injury or loss of life.\n\n\n5.5 Insurance with a Large Service Component\nMost insurance policies have some service component, which is discussed below. However, there are\na few types of insurance that have a large service component that is just as important, if not more\nimportant, than the insurance component that pays losses.\nBoiler and machinery insurance, a form of the broader equipment-breakdown category of insurance,\ncovers: the cost of repairing or replacing the equipment; and business losses incurred from an insured\nperil that renders the equipment unusable. A large component of boiler and machinery insurance is the\nat-least-annual inspections and pressure testing of the equipment that the insurer provides to the\ninsured to prevent losses.\nTitle insurance protects the buyer from losses due to defects in the title of real property that have\nalready occurred but are not known at the time the title insurance is purchased. A buyer who borrowers\n\n4\n    In some jurisdictions, motor/auto policies cover the drivers whether they are driving their own car or another\n    car. In other jurisdictions, motor/auto policies cover the vehicles regardless of who is driving at the time of the\n    accident. The insurance policy will specify the type of coverage that is provided, who is insured if the policy\n    covers the drivers, and which vehicle is insured if the policy covers the vehicle.\n\n                                                           11\n\f                                                                                             IAA Risk Book\n                                                                            Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\nmoney on a property may purchase title insurance to protect the lender against potential issues with\nthe propertyâs title. In some situations, a seller may purchase title insurance to protect the buyer of the\nproperty against potential issues with the propertyâs title. Prior to conveying property from one party to\nanother, the title insurer does an extensive records search looking for claims or liens of any kind against\nthe property, including back taxes and conflicting wills. In many jurisdictions, title of real property cannot\nbe conveyed without the type of search done by title insurers.\nFor some types of insurance, such as professional liability, legal defense is very important as it helps\nprotect the reputation of the insured. However, the defense costs may be treated as part of the loss, so\nthat there may be no funds remaining to pay any or all of whatever non-defense loss there may be.\n\n\n5.6 Emerging Non-Life Insurance Products\nNew non-life insurance products continue to emerge, driven by technological and societal changes. New\nitems, such as drones, need to be insured for both first-party losses due to physical damage and for\nthird-party losses if they damage other property or people.\nThe sharing economy provides opportunities for episodic insurance that covers first- and third-party\nlosses only for the period of time an item, such as a vehicle, is being shared or rented. This insurance\ncould be purchased by the property owner or the property renter.\nParametric insurance, which started in the 1990s, is becoming more popular, primarily for insuring\nagainst loss from natural catastrophes. This type of insurance pays a set amount when a triggered\nevent occurs. For example, it may pay the homeowner $100,000 if an earthquake with a magnitude of\n5.0 or greater occurs with an epicenter within a specified distance from the house. This type of\ninsurance has the advantage of compensating the claimant more quickly than the time it would take for\nthe normal investigation process performed by the insurance company to determine the value of a\nclaim. It has the disadvantage of not always paying for the full amount of the loss, and it may not pay\nanything if the house is damaged but the trigger is not met. Many accounting systems treat these\ncontracts as derivative investments and not insurance contracts.\n\n\n6     Characteristics of Non-Life Insurance\nNon-life insurance has many characteristics that are different from life insurance, annuities, and pension\nobligations. The primary ones are discussed below.\n\n\n6.1   Policy Length\nNon-life policies usually are one-year contracts, although multi-year contracts exist for some types of\nrisks. Each time an insurance contract is renewed, it is a new contract. The coverage and pricing may\nchange materially from one year to the next. This allows for quick mitigation or correction for arising\nissues. Examples of multi-year contracts are warranty and mortgage guarantee policies.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     12\n\f                                                                                                  IAA Risk Book\n                                                                                 Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\n6.2 Named Insured, Additional Insured, and Additional Named Insured\nThe ânamed insuredâ is the person (or people) or business (or businesses) named in the policy. There\ncan be more than one named insured. The named insured usually appears on the first page of the policy.\nNamed insureds have the broadest protection under the policy. The named insureds usually determine\nthe type and amounts of coverage, receive the premium notice and any notices of endorsement or\ncancellation, and pay the premium.\nAn âadditional insuredâ is a person or business added by endorsement. The endorsement usually\nprovides coverage for the additional insured only for acts of error or omission by the named insured.\nAdditional insureds usually do not receive notices about the policy and do not pay the premium.\nAn âadditional named insuredâ is a person or business named somewhere in the policy other than the\nfirst page. An additional named insured usually has the same rights as the named insured but is not\nresponsible for paying the premium.\n\n\n6.3 Indemnification versus Pay-on-Behalf-of5\nNon-life policies that indemnify the insured normally require the insured to first pay the losses that the\ninsurer will then reimburse. These losses may be paid as multiple partial payments by the insured over\ntime with partial reimbursement following.\nFor non-life policies that use pay-on-behalf-of language, the insurer will make the payment on behalf of\nthe insured. The insured does not directly pay the losses.\n\n\n6.4 Principle-Based Definition of Loss\nMost non-life policies use a principle-based definition of loss, rather than a stated amount. Financial or\neconomic losses are a reduction in the value of property, the financial consequences of damage to a\nperson, or the extra expenses of loss mitigation or business interruption, depending on the type of\ninsurance and perils covered. Non-financial or non-economic damages are values set by negotiation or\nlegal/tort/court actions for items such as pain, suffering, inconvenience, emotional distress, and loss\nof society and companionship.\n\n\n6.5 How Loss Is Determined\nBecause most non-life policies use a principle-based definition of loss, the amount of the loss is\ndetermined by the policy terms, investigation, negotiation, and possibly legal/tort/court actions.\n\n\n6.6 Invalid Claims\nSome claims for losses received by non-life insurers may be invalid. Consequently, one of the first\nactions an insurer takes is to verify that the claim is covered by the insurance policy. This means\n\n\n5\n    An exception to this is workersâ compensation insurance in the United States in which the insurer legally stands\n    in the shoes of the employer with direct responsibility to the insured employee.\n\n                                                         13\n\f                                                                                             IAA Risk Book\n                                                                            Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\nchecking that the person or entity saying they are insured is, in fact, insured by the insurer for the\ncircumstances (time, location, loss amount, etc.) of the claim.\nA claim also can be invalid if there is an insurance policy that might respond but coverage for a particular\nperil, such as earthquake, is not part of that policy. There also may be circumstances of the claim, such\nas the claim not being reported in a timely fashion, that might result in an invalid claim.\n\n\n6.7 Fraudulent Claims\nA fraudulent insurance claim arises when someone knowingly lies to obtain from an insurer a payment\nto which they are not otherwise entitled. While fraudulent claims can occur in life insurance, they are\nmuch more prevalent in non-life insurance. Examples of fraudulent claims in non-life insurance include:\n      ï·    Destroying property on purpose to collect the insurance on it;\n      ï·    Exaggerating the damage from an otherwise legitimate claim;\n      ï·    Filing claims for accidents that did not occur;\n      ï·    Purchasing insurance after an accident has occurred and claiming the accident occurred during\n           the policy period; and\n      ï·    Registering a vehicle in a location other than where it is based to get a lower premium, so that\n           the relationship of any loss to the premium is higher than it should be.\n\n\n6.8 Claim Notice Provision\nMost non-life insurance policies contain a claim notice provision that requires the insured to notify the\ninsurer promptly after a loss occurs or a claim is made against the insured or, in the case of claims-\nmade policies, becomes known to the insured.6 The claim notice provision may include a specific\ndeadline. The purpose of this provision is to provide the insurer with the opportunity to investigate the\ncircumstances of the claim as early as possible. If a claim is not filed with the insurer in a timely fashion\nas described in the claim notice provision, the insurer has the right to deny the claim.\n\n\n6.9 Moral and Morale Hazard\nNon-life insurance policies attempt to minimize moral and morale hazard. Losses due to moral hazard,\nsuch as a building burning down because the owner set it on fire, are not covered losses.\nLosses due to morale hazard may not be covered or may be reduced. For example, an insurer may not\npay any or all of the amount of the covered loss from a fire if it is determined that the sprinkler system\nhad not been maintained and was not operating at the time of the fire.\n\n\n6.10 Services\nThe administrative services an insurer provides both before and after a loss can be a major reason to\npurchase insurance. Most non-life insurance policies include services such as claim handling and legal\n\n6\n    Coverage triggers are discussed further in Section 6.12.\n\n                                                         14\n\f                                                                                           IAA Risk Book\n                                                                          Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\ndefense. For some non-life insurance policies, such as policies covering errors and omissions, these\nservices are the major part of the expected loss. Some non-life insurance policies also include loss\ncontrol help and assistance with arranging for repairs.\nFor some types of non-life insurance policies, the services are provided by the insurer before a loss\noccurs or even if no loss occurs. Boiler and machinery policies include engineering services. Title\ninsurance policies include extensive record searches for claims and liens that might impair the title.\n\n\n6.11 Claims versus Occurrences\nAn âoccurrenceâ usually is defined as an accident or event that results in loss neither expected nor\nintended by the insured. This could include continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same\nharmful conditions. A âclaimâ usually is defined as a demand by an insured to their insurer to recover\nfunds for a loss from an accident or event that may be covered by one of its insurance policies.\nOne loss event (occurrence) may result in multiple claims. A catastrophe such as a hurricane can\ndamage many vehicles, homes, and businesses. Each of these may have its own insurance policy that\nincludes the hurricane peril, so that there are many claims against many insurers. One automobile\naccident can result in damage to the insured vehicle with the at-fault driver, several other vehicles, and\npeople in both the insured and other vehicles, resulting in many claims against the policy covering the\nat-fault driverâs vehicle or the at-fault driver.\nMany parts of an insurance policy may rely on the definitions of \"claimâ and âoccurrence,â including any\n deductible or limits. For example, in an automobile accident involving two vehicles, the applicable\n insurance policy may have a limit on the amount it will pay for each bodily injury claim by an injured\n person (such as $100,000) and a higher limit for the amount it will pay for the bodily injury occurrence\n for all injured people (such as $300,000). If the accident resulted in four bodily injury claims of\n $150,000, $75,000, $75,000, and $75,000, the claim limit of $100,000 would apply to the first claim.\n That leaves the limited but not-yet-paid claims of $100,000, $75,000, $75,000, and $75,000, which total\n $325,000. As this is higher than the occurrence limit of $300,000, the total payment would be reduced\n by $25,000 to the $300,000 per occurrence limit. Different jurisdictions handle this situation in\n different ways, such as requiring a pro-rata reduction on the per-claim-limited amounts or paying\n claims in the order in which they were submitted with no payments made after the occurrence limit is\n reached.\nThere also may be differences in definitions and coverages between the insurance policies and any\napplicable reinsurance contracts. These differences may result in coverage disputes.\n\n\n6.12 Coverage Trigger\nA coverage trigger is an event that must occur before an insurance policy applies to a particular loss.\nThere are three types of coverage triggers:\n   ï·    Occurrence: Occurrence policies cover losses from events that occur during the policy period.\n   ï·    Claims-made: Claims-made policies cover losses that are reported during the policy period.\n        These policies have some additional characteristics. One example is a retroactive date, which\n\n                                                   15\n\f                                                                                                      IAA Risk Book\n                                                                                     Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\n           is the oldest date that a loss event could have occurred and be covered by the claims-made\n           policy. Another example is the possibility of purchasing tail coverage (sometimes called\n           âextended reporting period coverageâ) that extends the coverage by a specified length of time\n           past the policy period end for an additional premium. Professional liability policies often are\n           written on a claims-made basis and are less expensive than occurrence policies.\n      ï·    Claims-paid: A few non-life insurance policies cover losses when they are paid. On these\n           policies, if there is a reported claim for losses and it takes several years for it to be paid, the\n           insured must stay with the same insurer until the claim is paid or risk having to pay the claim\n           out of pocket. This gives the insurer the opportunity to increase the price of the insurance based\n           on its assessment of the amount it ultimately will have to pay for the loss. These policies tend\n           to be less expensive than occurrence or claims-made policies until there is a claim.\n\n\n6.13 Short-Tail versus Long-Tail Lines of Insurance\nThere are two types of lags that affect the time between the occurrence of a loss and the payment7\nassociated with loss:\n      ï·    Reporting Lag: This is the time between the date the loss event occurs and the date the loss is\n           reported to the insurer; and\n      ï·    Payment Lag: This is the time between the date the loss is reported to the insurer and the date\n           the final payment associated with that loss is made.\nFor some types of non-life insurance, such as health and workersâ compensation, the loss payment\nusually is made close to the time of the economic loss. For other types of non-life insurance, such as\nliability, the payment may be made in a lump sum and may reflect future losses, such as ongoing\nmedical care.\nSome types of non-life insurance are called âshort-tailâ because there is a relatively short time between\nthe occurrence and payment of loss. Health insurance and property insurance are examples of short-\ntail lines of insurance. Health and property claims tend to have a short reporting lag and a short payment\nlag. However, health insurance and property insurance claims may have a long payment lag if there is a\ncoverage dispute.\nOther types of non-life insurance are called âlong-tailâ because there is a relatively long time between\nthe occurrence and payment of loss due either to a reporting lag or a payment lag or both. Errors and\nomissions insurance is an example of a long-tail line of insurance. There may be both a reporting lag,\nbecause it may take a long time for an error or omission to be discovered, and a payment lag, because\nthe investigation takes a long time and settlement may involve a lengthy court case. For this reason,\nmany errors and omissions insurance policies are written on a claims-made policy form.\n\n\n\n7\n    Note that claim settlement and claim payment may not be the same. For example, there may be a claim\n    settlement (i.e., agreement) between the parties of a liability suit in which the insurer agrees to pay the costs for\n    a future medical procedure, but the final payment from this settlement will not occur until sometime in the future\n    when the medical procedure is done.\n\n                                                            16\n\f                                                                                            IAA Risk Book\n                                                                           Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\nWorkersâ compensation is considered a long-tail line because, while claims tend to be reported quickly\nand insurance payments are made close to the time of economic losses, the economic losses resulting\nfrom the workplace injury may go on for many years if, for example, the worker is permanently disabled.\n\n\n6.14 Actual Losses May Be Significantly Different from Expected Losses\nActual losses may be significantly different from the expected losses assumed in the premium rates\ndue to, for example:\n   ï·    Little or no data, resulting in a large number of assumptions;\n   ï·    Inaccurate data;\n   ï·    Unanticipated changes in the loss reporting and payment patterns;\n   ï·    Unanticipated changes in the legal environment (including legislation, propensity to sue and\n        jury awards);\n   ï·    Unanticipated changes in the economic environment (including policyholder behaviour);\n   ï·    Unanticipated changes in the social environment; and\n   ï·    The statistical fluctuation in losses around the expected value when all other factors remain\n        constant, also known as ârandom chance.â\nSee the Risk and Uncertainty chapter of the IAA Risk Book for a more in-depth discussion of this topic.\n\n\n6.15 Data Issues\nData used for setting rates and reserves for non-life insurance have some different challenges than\nthose of life insurance, annuities, and pension obligations. Some of the challenges are the same, such\nas coding and other accuracy issues, completeness, and timeliness, although even those have different\nfactors contributing to them.\nNon-life insurance claim volume for the insurer and sometimes for larger insureds and entities retaining\nrisk can be very large. This increases the number of coding and other accuracy issues.\nData often are proprietary, so that when an insured changes from one insurer to another, the new insurer\nmay not have access to the insuredâs claim history, which contributes to the completeness problem. Or\nthe new insurer may get access to the insuredâs claim history, but not on a timely basis.\nEven when the claim data are complete, accurate, and timely, the risk of loss for an insured or entity\nretaining loss may have changed from the experience period covered by the claim data, so that the claim\ndata cannot be used for analysis without adjustment for the changes.\nIn addition to data on loss payments, non-life insurance ratemaking and reserving frequently relies on\ncase reserves set by claim adjusters. Ideally, a case reserve for a particular claim reflects the adjusterâs\nopinion on the unpaid value of the losses and expenses allocated to handling the claim. The objective\nof setting a case reserve is determined by the claim department that can decide to use the expected\nunpaid value, the median unpaid value, the maximum unpaid value, or some other criterion. Case\nreserves should be re-evaluated as new information about or relevant to the claim becomes available.\n\n\n\n                                                    17\n\f                                                                                            IAA Risk Book\n                                                                           Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\nBecause non-life losses are determined by investigation, negotiation, and legal/tort/court actions, and\nbecause there tend to be a large number of claims, operational differences in claim handling can affect\nthe ultimate amount of the loss, the timing of the loss payment, the accuracy of case reserves, and the\ntiming of case reserve changes. Differences can arise between adjusters due to differences in judgment\neven if they are following the same claim handling procedures. There also may be differences over time\ndue to internal changes in claim handling procedures at one insurer, as well as differences in the claim\nhandling procedures of different insurers. These differences make analyzing non-life claim data to set\nrates and reserves more challenging than analyzing claim data to set rates and reserves for life\ninsurance, annuities, and pension obligations.\nThere is a need for an actuarial evaluation of the aggregate results to arrive at an appropriate reserve\nestimate for financial statement purposes and for use in setting rates due to the following:\n   ï·    The changes in case reserves as new information becomes available;\n   ï·    The differences in case reserves for the variety of situations mentioned above; and\n   ï·    Changes, such as in payment patterns, that reflect the ultimate cost of claims.\nSome insurers may not have a large enough data set of their own and need to rely on data from outside\nsources, such as industry associations. This adds another layer of complexity to assessing the\nappropriateness of the data used setting rates and reserves.\n\n\n6.16 Salvage and Subrogation\nNon-life insurance may include the right of salvage and subrogation.\n   ï·    Salvage: This is the sale of damaged goods (or usable parts from damaged goods) by the\n        insurer after the insurer has paid the insured for the loss and taken title of the damaged\n        property. An example is an insurer selling usable parts of a damaged vehicle for which it has\n        paid the motor/auto physical damage claim.\n   ï·    Subrogation: This is the collection by the insurer of funds from a negligent third party or the\n        negligent third partyâs insurer after the insurer has paid a claim for its own insured. For example,\n        this may occur after an insurer pays its insured for bodily injury to the driver and vehicle\n        occupants and property damage to the insuredâs vehicle and then recovers part or all of those\n        costs from the negligent third party.\nThere is a lag between when an insurer pays the loss and when it receives the funds from salvage and\nsubrogation. This lag may be quite long if litigation regarding who is negligent is involved. Collection of\nthese funds results in negative loss payments and can complicate non-life insurance ratemaking and\nreserving.\n\n\n6.17 Learning About the Insured\nFor life insurance, annuities, and pension obligations, the insurer usually knows the most about the\ninsured at the beginning of its association with the insured. In non-life insurance, the insurer knows\nmore about an insured the longer it is insured with the same insurer. This occurs because the non-life\n\n\n                                                    18\n\f                                                                                             IAA Risk Book\n                                                                            Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\ninsurer is getting updated information at each renewal, and life insurance, annuities, and pension\nobligations usually do not require periodic renewal.8\n\n\n6.18 Emerging Products\nNon-life insurance tends to have a large number of emerging products compared to life insurance,\nannuities and pension obligations. (Examples of emerging non-life products were discussed in Section\n5.6.) This increases the time and energy needed to create and evaluate these opportunities.\n\n\n6.19 Changes in Existing Risks\nEven with existing risks and perils, non-life insurance sometimes experiences rapid changes in those\nrisks. For example, cell phones, backup cameras, driver assist features such as automatic braking, and\ntelematic devices have had significant impacts on motor/auto losses in short periods of time.\nClimate risks such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires are contemplated in many non-life insurance\nproducts. Consideration needs to be given to how climate risks are changing over time and how those\nchanges might impact the insurance products and their pricing.\n\n\n6.20 Reinsurance\nReinsurance is insurance one insurer purchases from another insurer or reinsurer to protect itself at\nleast partially from a significant occurrence or a series of unusual occurrences. The insurer purchasing\nthe reinsurance is âthe ceding companyâ or âthe cedent.â The insurer providing the reinsurance is the\nâreinsurer.â The reinsurer assumes some of the financial responsibility of loss from the cedent, but the\nceding company retains the responsibility for paying its claims if the reinsurer is unable to meet the\nfinancial obligations related to those claims.\nThere are two basic methods of reinsurance:\n     ï·    Facultative, which is negotiated separately for each insurance policy that is reinsured; and\n     ï·    Treaty, in which the cedent and reinsurer negotiate and execute a reinsurance contract under\n          which the reinsurer agrees to cover a specified share of the cedentâs losses that are covered by\n          the insurance policies issued by the cedent that come within the scope of the contract.\nThere are two main types of treaty reinsurance:\n     ï·    Proportional; and\n     ï·    Non-proportional.\nIn proportional reinsurance, the cedents and reinsurers share the losses based on a specified\npercentage agreed upon in the reinsurance contract. In non-proportional reinsurance, the reinsurer\nassumes the losses beyond a certain threshold, often up to a specified limit, with both the threshold\nand limit listed in the contract. Non-proportional reinsurance is used extensively in non-life insurance,\n\n8\n    Group pension obligations may require periodic updates regarding the people covered by the plan and their\n    demographics.\n\n                                                      19\n\f                                                                                           IAA Risk Book\n                                                                          Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\nbut much less often in life and health insurance. Non-proportional reinsurance is discussed in detail in\nthe Non-Proportional Reinsurance chapter of the IAA Risk Book.\nCeded reinsurance is discussed in more detail in the Liabilities for General Insurance chapter of the IAA\nRisk Book.\nThese concepts also apply to individual entities retaining risk and to groups of entities sharing risk that\nare not insurers. In these instances, the insurer is providing âexcess insuranceâ rather than\nâreinsurance.â\n\n\n7       The Non-Life Insurance Contract\nThe insurance contract structure is the same for both personal lines insurance and commercial lines\ninsurance. The key components are:\n    ï·    Declarations;\n    ï·    The insurance agreement;\n    ï·    Definitions;\n    ï·    Exclusions; and\n    ï·    Conditions.\nSome policies also contain endorsements (discussed further below).\nThere are two elements needed for an insured to decide to buy an insurance contract (also called\nâinsurance policyâ):\n    ï·    Meaningful loss: The size of the possible loss covered by the insurance contract must be\n         meaningful from the perspective of the insured. Insurance premiums cover the costs of:\n         o   Selling, issuing and administering the policy;\n         o   Losses;\n         o   Handling the claims for losses;\n         o   Associated services such as inspection, loss control and legal defense; and\n         o   Supplying enough capital for the insurer to be reasonably certain to be able to pay the\n             losses.\n         For small losses, the insurance premium may be many times the size of the expected losses.\n         It may not make sense to purchase insurance for small losses unless they have a real value to\n         the insured. An insurance policy may address this by containing a deductible for losses the\n         insured must pay before the insurer pays.\n    ï·    Affordable premium: The insured must consider the premium paid for the insurance coverage\n         to be reasonable in relationship to the protection offered and services provided and to be\n         affordable. The insurance policy premium may be reduced by including a deductible, limiting\n         the amount of loss with a policy limit, excluding some perils and risks, or in other ways.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    20\n\f                                                                                           IAA Risk Book\n                                                                          Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\n7.1 Declarations\nThe Declarations page usually is the first page of the policy. It summarizes key information, including:\n   ï·    The named insured(s) and corresponding address(es);\n   ï·    The insurance policy start and end dates (the policy term);\n   ï·    A brief description of the insured item;\n   ï·    A brief description of the coverages provided;\n   ï·    Coverage deductibles and limits;\n   ï·    The premium; and\n   ï·    Endorsements applicable to the policy.\nThere may be additional information, such as the exposure details and rates.\n\n\n7.2 The Insuring Agreement\nThe insuring agreement specifies in more detail who and/or what is covered and the policy term.\nCoverage is either provided for all perils with some exceptions or for named (or specified) perils. There\nmay be more than one type of coverage on a policy, such as property and liability on a\nhomeowners/residential policy. The insuring agreement usually specifies whether the coverage trigger\nis for occurrences, claims made, or claims paid.\nOther parts of the insurance policy may limit or exclude coverages. Either the insuring agreement or\nanother part of the policy will list the maximum amount the policy will pay per claim, per occurrence, or\nin aggregate (for all losses considered together after any per claim or per occurrence limits are applied).\nEither the insurance agreement or another part of the policy also will list any deductibles the insured\nmay be responsible for paying before the insurance policy provides coverage.\n\n\n7.3 Definitions\nDefinitions of some terms are included since non-life insurance policies may contain common words\nthat have special meanings within the context of the insurance policy, as well as uncommon words with\nwhich the insured may not be familiar. Some definitions may limit coverage. Non-life insurance policies\ncontain a section that defines these terms.\n\n\n7.4 Exclusions\nThe exclusions eliminate coverage for specified perils or risks. Exclusions can appear anywhere in an\ninsurance policy, but most are in a specific âExclusionsâ section of the policy.\nExclusions also can increase coverage by excluding certain perils or risks from the exclusion. For\nexample, in a commercial general liability policy in the United States of America, an Aircraft, Auto, or\nWatercraft Exclusion may eliminate coverage for the ownership, maintenance, use, or entrustment of\nthese vehicles or vessels. However, there may be exceptions where the policy does cover watercraft,\nsuch as while ashore on the insuredâs premises or for certain non-owned watercraft.\n\n\n                                                    21\n\f                                                                                           IAA Risk Book\n                                                                          Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\n7.5 Conditions\nConditions in a non-life insurance policy contain additional requirements such as the timing of premium\npayment and reporting of a loss. The insurer may require the insured to perform certain actions after a\nloss.\nSome policies contain a reinstatement clause that outlines the conditions under which coverage is reset\nafter the insured files a claim due to loss. The coverage limit may be changed or reset to the original\namount. For example, an insured building that is partially damaged by fire may have the coverage limit\nreduced to the value of the remainder of the building until the damaged has been restored, at which time\nthe coverage limit can be reset to the new value of the building, which may require additional premium.\nThe conditions may allow for a premium audit after the policy ends when the policy premium is based\non information not fully known or knowable at inception. Any difference between the initial premium\nand the audited premium is either returned to the insured if the initial premium is higher than the audited\npremium or collected from the insured if the initial premium is lower than the audited premium.\nSome non-life policies contain a provision for retrospective rating, with the premium for the policy\nevaluated periodically after the policy ends with the final premium being a function of the actual losses.\n\n\n7.6 Endorsements\nMany non-life insurance policies are written on standardized policy forms, as opposed to customized\nor âmanuscriptâ policies. Endorsements, which may be standardized or customized, may add coverage,\nmodify coverage, or exclude coverage.\n\n\n8     Other Issues\nThere are other issues in non-life insurance that are different from those that arise regarding life\ninsurance, annuities, and pension obligations or are the same but have different characteristics.\n\n\n8.1 Adverse Selection\nIn an ideal world, buyers (the insured) and sellers (the insurer) have the same information so they can\nreach a fair price for what is being purchased. Adverse selection may occur when the insured has\ninformation about their risk of loss that the insurer does not have. For example, a factory seeking\nproperty insurance may have a sprinkler system that is not working, but the factory management does\nnot disclose this information to the insurer on its insurance application. The insurer can counter this\nlack of knowledge by doing an inspection. If the insurer learns of this information, which increases the\nfire risk, the insurer may decline to write the insurance policy, charge a higher price, add a large\ndeductible, lower the policy limit, or include a policy condition such that loss payment resulting from a\nfire is contingent upon a properly functioning sprinkler system at the time of the fire.\nAdverse selection also can result from government regulations prohibiting insurers from setting prices\nbased on certain information. For example, if health insurers are not allowed to charge higher prices for\npre-existing conditions, people with pre-existing conditions are more likely to buy health insurance than\n\n\n                                                    22\n\f                                                                                          IAA Risk Book\n                                                                         Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\npeople without them, so the pool of actual insureds will have higher losses than contemplated in the\nrates. If everyone must purchase health insurance, then adverse selection should be reduced or at least\nbecome predictable, so that rates can be set for a group of insureds with known characteristics.\n\n\n8.2 Mandatory Coverages\nSome jurisdictions require the purchase of insurance for certain perils. Motor/auto liability with\nspecified minimum limits, workersâ compensation insurance, and health insurance are examples of\nmandatory coverages in some jurisdictions. The mandates can sometimes be met with other risk\nfinancing options, such as risk retention programs approved by the government.\nThere also are situations in which insurance is mandated by a third party. A lender may require a person\nor business taking out a mortgage on a property to purchase mortgage insurance with the lender as one\nof the named insureds. A landlord or property manager may require a tenant using the property to have\nliability insurance. These mandatory coverages are usually spelled out in the relevant contracts.\nSome jurisdictions also have money laundering and sanctions laws that make it illegal for insurers to\nprovide insurance to certain entities that under the mandatory coverage laws are required to purchase\ninsurance.\n\n\n8.3 Residual Markets\nResidual markets exist to provide insurance to people and businesses that are considered high risk and\nhave trouble purchasing insurance in the voluntary market when society views the lack of insurance\navailability and/or affordability to be unacceptable. They also may exist when the voluntary market is\nvery small or very expensive because the risks, such as to flood, are very large.\nIf the government mandates insurance when there is a voluntary insurance market for that insurance,\nthis always leads to a residual market because not all potential insureds will be offered coverage by the\nvoluntary insurance market. However, residual markets can exist even if there is no mandatory\ncoverage. The most common types of residual markets are for workersâ compensation, motor/auto\nliability, and property insurance.\nThere are several mechanisms by which a residual market can operate. The most common are:\n   ï·    Separate insurer with assessments: A residual market can be set up as a separate insurer with\n        assessments against voluntary writers to cover losses in excess of those contemplated in the\n        rates. The assessments usually are in proportion to the premium written by the insurers in the\n        voluntary market.\n   ï·    Separate insurer with government backing: A residual market can be set up as a separate\n        insurer with rates that are affordable but may not cover the costs of the insurance. Any losses\n        and expenses in excess of the premium are covered by government funds from sources other\n        than the premium.\n   ï·    One or a small number of insurers with voluntary market reinsurers: One or a small number of\n        insurers is selected to service the residual market, but all the insurers in the voluntary market\n\n\n\n                                                   23\n\f                                                                                         IAA Risk Book\n                                                                        Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\n        participate in a reinsurance program that can cover either all the losses or only the losses in\n        excess of those contemplated in the rates, depending on the program details. The reinsurance\n        premium for each insured is usually determined in proportion to the premium written in the\n        voluntary market.\n   ï·    Handled by voluntary market insurers: Insurers in the voluntary market may be required to\n        directly insure the people or businesses that qualify for the residual market at premium rates\n        determined by the government. Each insurerâs share of the residual market usually is in\n        proportion to their percentage of the voluntary premium in the market.\n\n\n8.4 Government Insurance Programs\nThere are some risks that are so large or uncertain that the voluntary insurance market is unwilling to\ninsure them. The government may decide that insurance coverage should be available for these risks\nfor public policy reasons and provide insurance directly or reinsure losses from these risks if insurers\nwill write the insurance policies and take some of the financial responsibility for these risks.\nGovernments may also fund these insurance coverages through taxation or other levies. Examples of\nthese types of risks are terrorism and floods.\n\n\n8.5 Underwriting Requirements\nSome jurisdictions have restrictions on underwriting criteria. For example, even though on average\nyoung men tend to have more motor/auto accidents than young women, some jurisdictions may not\nallow insurers to charge young men a higher price than young women for the same coverage. This may\nmean that the young womenâs premium is subsidizing the young menâs losses.\nIn some jurisdictions there is mandatory acceptance of insureds. This is the case with residual markets.\nFor example, an insured may be required to be accepted by a residual market if it has received three\nrejections in a short period of time for insurance in the voluntary market.\n\n\n8.6 Rate and Policy Form Regulation\nSome jurisdictions regulate rates and policy forms, and some do not. In addition, some jurisdictions\nregulate different lines of business in different ways. For example, a jurisdiction may require prior\napproval for personal lines but have open competition for commercial lines.\nThere are three reasons why rates might be regulated:\n   ï·    Not excessive: Regulators may want to be certain that rates are not too high in relation to the\n        costs associated with the insurance provided to protect consumers, particularly if the insurance\n        is required or necessary in certain circumstances.\n    ï·   Adequate: Regulators may want to be certain that rates are not too low. If insurers do not\n        charge enough to cover their costs, they eventually will go out of business and be unavailable\n        to pay losses.\n    ï·   Prevent discrimination: Insurers are permitted to discriminate between buyers in ways that\n        make sense and are societally acceptable. For example, an insurer is allowed to charge more\n\n                                                  24\n\f                                                                                             IAA Risk Book\n                                                                            Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\n          for a property policy for a building with no sprinklers than for a building with a functioning\n          sprinkler system. However, an insurer may not be allowed to discriminate based on factors that\n          are not related to the risk, such as race, religion, or national origin. An insurer also may not be\n          allowed to discriminate based on a factor that is related to the risk if it is considered socially\n          unacceptable to do so, such as gender for motor/auto insurance.\nRates can be regulated in a variety of ways:\n      ï·   Prior approval: Insurers must submit rates to the rating authority and get approval before using\n          them. In some jurisdictions, an insurer may assume that rates are approved if it has not had a\n          response to the rate filing within a specified time period, such as 90 days.\n      ï·   File and use: Insurers must file their rates with the rating authority but may begin using them\n          immediately after filing.\n      ï·   Use and file: Insurers may use their new rates immediately but must file them with the rating\n          authority within a specified time period.\n      ï·   Open competition: Insurers are not required to file rates to obtain approval from a rating\n          authority.\n      ï·   Rates set by government: In some jurisdictions, the rates are set by the government. Insurers\n          that wish to write policies in the jurisdiction must use the governmentâs rates.\nSome jurisdictions also regulate policy forms to ensure that insurance policy provisions comply with\nthe law, are reasonable and fair, and do not contain major gaps in coverage that might be misunderstood\nby insureds and leave them unprotected. Policy forms can be regulated in the same ways as rates.\nJurisdictions may regulate policy forms in one way, such as prior approval, and rates in another way,\nsuch as file and use.\n\n8.7       Changes in Rate Making\nThis chapter does not address non-life rate making. However, there are recent and emerging changes\nin rate making that are relevant to this section.\nOriginally rates were based on large groups of insureds. Over time, insurers started breaking the groups\ninto smaller, more homogeneous groups, such as smokers and non-smokers for health insurance, and\ncharging them different rates that more closely aligned to their risk of loss to gain a competitive\nadvantage and mitigate adverse selection. The widespread use of more powerful computers and new\ntechnology provides more opportunities for individualized underwriting in which data, such as an\nindividualâs credit history or actual usage of a vehicle, can be used in the underwriting process. There is\nevidence that an individual who demonstrates financial responsibility as indicated by a high credit score\nwill have fewer and less costly losses for certain types of insurance, such as health, motor/auto, and\nhome/residential insurance. There also is evidence that individuals who do not exceed the speed limit\nwill have fewer and less costly automobile claims.\nWith the widespread use of more powerful computers and technology advancements, data analytics\n(i.e., the science of analyzing large sets of data to draw conclusions about items that may be correlated)\nhave become a tool used by insurers to improve their rate classification system.\n\n\n                                                     25\n\f                                                                                              IAA Risk Book\n                                                                             Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\n8.8       Changes in Coverage Terms After Policy Is Written and Paid For\nIn some jurisdictions, coverage may change after a non-life insurance policy is written and paid for.\nThese unintended coverage changes often are the result of legal rulings. For example, in the United\nStates some courts have ruled that older commercial general liability policies must pay for asbestos\nliability claims when the policy language is silent, neither stating that it is covered or excluded. As the\nrates for those policies were set without contemplating asbestos liability claims, the premium paid\nusually was not adequate to pay the losses, and insurers have had to use their surplus/equity to pay\nthem.\n\n\n8.9       Retroactive Insurance\nSome non-life insurance policies provide retroactive insurance for losses that have already occurred.\nThere are several types of retroactive insurance, including:\n      ï·   Tail policies: When an insured has purchased claims-made insurance and wishes to stop the\n          business that is insured, such as when a physician retires or a company is being sold, or convert\n          to occurrence-based insurance, there may be claims that have occurred but not been reported.\n          The insured may choose to purchase insurance for that set of claims by purchasing the tail\n          coverage on its last claims-made policy or by purchasing a separate tail policy that will cover\n          only those claims. A similar situation exists with claims-paid policies, although any claims that\n          have been reported but are unpaid usually are not covered by the tail policy.\n      ï·   Loss portfolio transfer: Sometimes an entity retaining risk, or an insurer, wishes to remove part\n          or all of its claims liability from its financial statement and transfer the financial responsibility\n          to another insurer. This is a transaction in which the premium paid by the ceding entity reflects\n          the expectation of loss and expense associated with the claims liability being transferred and\n          the risk of assuming those liabilities, with both discounted for the time value of money. This\n          may result in the premium for the loss portfolio transfer being less that claims liability being\n          transferred.\n      ï·   Purchase of one loss: While unusual, there are instances in which an insurer will sell the losses\n          for one large unpaid occurrence to a reinsurer. In addition to the financial considerations, it may\n          be that the reinsurer is better equipped to handle the particular type of loss than the insurer.\n\n\n8.10 Bad Faith Claims\nSometimes there can be a legitimate dispute over policy language or the interpretation of what is\nconsidered an insured event. In other instances, some insurers may attempt to not meet their\nobligations to their insureds by not paying legitimate claims in a timely fashion or by refusing to\ninvestigate and process claims in a timely fashion. Other types of bad faith include misrepresenting an\ninsurance policyâs language to avoid paying a claim, failing to disclose policy limitations and exclusions\nto insureds before they purchase a policy, or making an unreasonable demand on the insured to prove\na covered loss. In some jurisdictions the insured has the right to take legal action against the insurer,\nwhile in other jurisdictions the insurance policy contains a contractual remedy.\n\n\n\n                                                      26\n\f                                                                                            IAA Risk Book\n                                                                           Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\nIf the insuredâs claim of bad faith is successful, the insurer can end up paying more money than the\noriginal value of the policy. There are two types of such payments:\n   ï·    Excess of policy limits loss: A loss paid in excess of the underlying policy limits if the loss\n        results from the insurer not settling the loss within policy limits due to bad faith, fraud, or gross\n        negligence; and\n   ï·    Extra contractual obligations: A loss paid for damages to an insured from an insurer not\n        handling the claim in a responsible manner or not properly defending a claim.\nSome reinsurance contracts cover these types of losses.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    27\n\f                                                                                    IAA Risk Book\n                                                                   Non-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\n\nIAA Risk Book\nNon-Life Perils and Coverages\n\n\n\n\nWebsite: See www.actuaries.org/IAA/IAA/Publications/iaa_risk_book.aspx\nFeedback: Please send to riskbookcomments@actuaries.org\n\n\n\n\nÂ© International Actuarial Association/\nAssociation Actuarial Internationale\n\n\n\n\n                                              28",
