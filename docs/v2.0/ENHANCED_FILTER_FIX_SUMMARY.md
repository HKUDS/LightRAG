# Enhanced Relationship Filter Configuration Fix

## Issue Summary

The enhanced relationship quality filter was running despite having `ENABLE_ENHANCED_RELATIONSHIP_FILTER=false` in the `.env` file.

## Root Cause

The issue was in how the configuration was passed from `AdvancedLightRAG` to the filtering functions in `operate.py`:

1. **AdvancedLightRAG** dynamically adds enhanced filter configuration attributes in its `__init__` method:
   - `self.enable_enhanced_relationship_filter`
   - `self.log_relationship_classification`
   - `self.relationship_filter_performance_tracking`
   - etc.

2. When calling functions in `operate.py`, the code used `asdict(self)` to convert the instance to a configuration dictionary.

3. **The Problem**: `asdict()` only includes fields defined in the `@dataclass` decorator, NOT dynamically added attributes. Since the enhanced filter settings were added in `__init__`, they were not included in the config passed to `operate.py`.

4. As a result, `operate.py` would check for `enable_enhanced_relationship_filter` in the config, not find it, and use the default value from `constants.py` which was `True`.

## Solution Implemented

1. Added a new method `_get_enhanced_config()` to `AdvancedLightRAG` that:
   - Starts with the base config from `asdict(self)`
   - Manually adds all enhanced filter configuration attributes
   - Returns the complete configuration dictionary

2. Replaced all occurrences of `asdict(self)` with `self._get_enhanced_config()` in the `AdvancedLightRAG` class.

## Files Modified

- `/home/jason/Documents/DatabaseAdvancedTokenizer/RagAgent/TLL_Lightrag/LightRAG/lightrag/advanced_lightrag.py`
  - Added `_get_enhanced_config()` method
  - Replaced all `asdict(self)` calls with `self._get_enhanced_config()`

## Verification

The fix ensures that when `ENABLE_ENHANCED_RELATIONSHIP_FILTER=false` is set in `.env`:
1. The value is correctly read by `AdvancedLightRAG`
2. The value is properly passed to `operate.py` functions
3. The enhanced filter will be disabled as expected

## Configuration Reminder

To disable the enhanced relationship filter, ensure your `.env` file contains:
```
ENABLE_ENHANCED_RELATIONSHIP_FILTER=false
```

The filter logs showing "Enhanced relationship quality filter removed X/Y relationships" should no longer appear when this is set to false.
