In \nthe time between every edition, a world of change has occurred. Some organizations have ceased to exist, and new organizations have emerged. Older technologies have reached end of life while technologies offering completely new capabilities have evolved. People who continue in the workforce have advanced their thinking, skills, and capabilities as new entrants focus on quickly understanding their professional language, building their skills, developing their business acumen, and contributing to the objectives of their employers.\nEven in the midst of such changes, though, there are fundamental concepts and constructs \nthat remain in place. The understanding that collective thinking produces more holistic solutions than the thoughts of one individual continues. And the fact that organizations use projects as  \na vehicle for delivering a unique result or output endures.\nCUSTOMER- AND END-USER-CENTERED DESIGN\nWhile the Sixth Edition of the PMBOK® Guide was under development and throughout development \nof this Seventh Edition, PMI has actively engaged with a broad range of global stakeholders on their experiences with using The Standard for Project Management  and the PMBOK\n® Guide. These engagements \nhave included:\n▶Online surveys to representative samples of PMI stakeholders;\n▶Focus groups with PMO leaders, project managers, agile practitioners, project team\nmembers, and educators and trainers; and\n▶Interactive workshops with practitioners at various PMI events around the globe.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021viiiThe feedback and inputs collectively emphasized four key points:\n▶Maintain and enhance the credibility and relevance of the PMBOK® Guide.\n▶Improve the readability and usefulness of the PMBOK® Guide while avoiding overstuffing\nit with new content.\n▶Sense stakeholder information and content needs and provide vetted supplemental\ncontent supporting practical application.\n▶Recognize that there is continued value for some stakeholders in the structure and content\nof previous editions so that any shifts enhance without negating that value.\nSUSTAINING THE RELEVANCE OF THE PMBOK® GUIDE\nSince its inception as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)  in 1987, A Guide to the \nProject Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) has evolved while recognizing that fundamental \nelements of project management endure. Its evolution has not just involved an increase in the page \ncount, it has also involved significant and substantive changes in the nature of the content. A sampling of some of those key changes is reflected in the following table:\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021ixEvolution of Key Changes in the PMBOK® Guide\nPMBOK®  Guide\nEditionKey Evolutionary  Changes\n•Distinguished as “a guide to the body of knowledge, ” rather than the body of knowledge for project\nmanagement.\n•Reflected the subset of the project management body of knowledge that is “generally accepted, ” \nmeaning applicable to most projects most of the time with widespread consensus that practices ha ve\nvalue and usefulness.\n•Defined project management as “the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project\nactivities in order to meet or exceed stakeholder needs and expectations [emphasis added] from\na project. ”\n•Specific decision to shift to a process-based standard driven by  a desire to show interactions among\nKnowledge Areas; create a robust and flexible structure; and recognize that ISO and other standardsorganizations were establishing process-based standards.\n•First edition to incorporate the “ANSI Standard” logo on the co ver.\n•First edition to formally designate The Standard for Project Management of a Project separate and\ndistinct from the Project Management Frame work and Body of Knowledge.\n•Included material “generally recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time. ”\n•Defined project management as “the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project\nactivities to meet the project requirements.”\n•First edition to make  a distinct separation between the ANSI standard and the guide.\n•First time “agile” content is incorporated into the text, not just referenced in examples.\n•Expansion of Knowledge Area front material, including ke y concepts, trends and emerging practices, \ntailoring considerations, and considerations for agile/adaptive environments.1996\nThird (2004)\nSixth (2017)\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021xLike previous editions of The Standard for Project Management  and the PMBOK® Guide, this \nedition recognizes that the project management landscape continues to evolve and adapt. Over the \npast 10 years alone, the advancement of software into all types of products, services, and solutions has grown exponentially. What software can enable continues to change as artificial intelligence, cloud-based capabilities, and new business models drive innovation and new ways of working. Transformed organizational models have yielded new project work and team structures, the need for a broad range of approaches to project and product delivery, and a stronger focus on outcomes rather than deliverables. Individual contributors can join project teams from anywhere in the world, serve in a broader array of roles, and enable new ways of thinking and working collaboratively. These changes and more have created this opportunity to reconsider perspectives to support the continued evolution of The Standard for Project Management  and the PMBOK\n® Guide.\nSUMMARY OF CHANGES\nSince 1987, The Standard for Project Management  has represented a process-based standard. \nThe Standard for Project Management  included in the PMBOK® Guide aligned the project management \ndiscipline and function around a collection of business processes. Those business processes enabled consistent and predictable practices:\n▶That could be documented;\n▶Through which performance against the processes could be assessed; and\n▶Through which improvements to the process could be made to maximize efficiency\nand minimize threats.",

    "content": "SUMMARY OF CHANGES\nSince 1987, The Standard for Project Management  has represented a process-based standard. \nThe Standard for Project Management  included in the PMBOK® Guide aligned the project management \ndiscipline and function around a collection of business processes. Those business processes enabled consistent and predictable practices:\n▶That could be documented;\n▶Through which performance against the processes could be assessed; and\n▶Through which improvements to the process could be made to maximize efficiency\nand minimize threats.\nWhile effective in supporting good practice, process-based standards are prescriptive by their \nvery nature. With project management evolving more rapidly than ever before, the process-based orientation of past editions cannot be maintained in a manner conducive to reflecting the full value delivery landscape. Therefore, this edition shifts to a principles-based standard to support effective project management and to focus more on intended outcomes rather than deliverables.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021xiA global community of practitioners from different industries and organizations, in different \nroles, and working on different types of projects have developed and/or provided feedback on drafts \nof the standard as it has evolved for this edition. In addition, the PMBOK® Guide – Seventh Edition \ncoleaders and staff reviewed other bodies of knowledge and works focused on project management \nto identify principle concepts embedded in those texts. These combined e fforts showed strong \nalignment and supported the validation that the guiding principles in this edition of the standard \napply across the spectrum of project management.\nTo date, the global project management community has embraced the shift of this standard \ntoward a set of principle statements. The principle statements capture and summarize generally \naccepted objectives for the practice of project management and its core functions. The principle \nstatements provide broad parameters within which project teams can operate and o ffer many ways \nto remain aligned with the intent of the principles.\nUsing these principle statements, PMI can reflect effective management of projects across the \nfull value delivery landscape: predictive to adaptive and everything in between. This principles-based \napproach is also consistent with the evolution of The Standard for Program Management  (Third and \nFourth Editions) and The Standard for Portfolio Management  – Fourth Edition. The Standard for Risk \nManagement in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects  and Benefits Realization Management: A Practice Guide  \nrepresent new standard products intentionally developed with a principles-based focus by global \nteams of subject matter experts.\nNothing in this edition of The Standard for Project Management or A Guide to the Pr oject \nManagement Body o f Knowledge negates  alignment with the process-base d approach of past  \neditions. Many organizations and practitioners co ntinue to find that approach useful for guiding \ntheir project management capabilities, aligning their methodologi es, and evaluating their project \nmanagement capabilities. That appro ach remains relev ant in the context of this new edi tion.\nAnother significant change with this edition of the PMBOK® Guide is a systems view of project \nmanagement. This shift begins with a systems view of value delivery as part of The Standard for \nProject Management  and continues with the presentation of the PMBOK® Guide content. A systems \nfocus for value delivery changes the perspective from one of governing portfolios, programs, and \nprojects to focusing on the value chain that links those and other business capabilities to advancing \norganizational strategy, value, and business objectives. In the context of project management,  \nThe Standard for Project Management  and the PMBOK® Guide emphasize that projects do not simply \nproduce outputs, but more importantly, enable those outputs to drive outcomes that ultimately \ndeliver value to the organization and its stakeholders.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021xiiThis systems vie w reflects a shift  from the Knowledge Areas in past editions of t he PMBOK® Guide \nto eight project pe rformance domains. A performance domain is a gro up of related activities that are  \ncritical for the effective delivery of project outcomes. Collectively, the performance  domains represent  \na project manageme nt system of int eractive, interrelated, and int erdependent management capabilitie s \nthat work in uniso n to achieve desired project outcomes. As the performance domains interact and react  \nto each other, change occurs. Project teams continuously review, discuss, adapt, and respond to such \nchanges with the whole system in mind—not just the s pecific performance domain in which the change \noccurred. Aligned with the concept of a system for v alue delivery in The Standard f or Project Management , \nteams evaluate effective performanc e in each performance domain thro ugh outcomes-fo cused \nmeasures, rather than through adhe rence to processes or the product ion of artifacts , plans, etc.\nPrevious editions of the PMBOK® Guide emphasized the importance of tailoring the project \nmanagement approach to the unique characteristics of each project and its context. The Sixth \nEdition specifically incorporated considerations to help project teams think about how to tailor their \napproach to project management. That content was included in the front matter of each of the \nKnowledge Areas and provided considerations for all types of project environments. This edition \nfurther expands upon that work with a dedicated section on Tailoring in the PMBOK® Guide.\nA new section on Models, Methods, and Artifacts provides a high-level grouping of models, \nmethods, and artifacts that support project management. This section maintains linkages to \ntools, techniques, and outputs from previous editions that support project management without \nprescribing when, how, or which tools teams should use.\nThe final change reflects the most significant advancement in the PMBOK® Guide’s history— \nthe creation of PMIstandards+™, an interactive digital platform that  incorporates current, emerging, \nand future practices, methods, artifact s, and other useful informatio n. The digital content bet ter \nreflects the dynamic nature of a bo dy of knowledge. PMIstandards",

This standard applies regardless of industry, location, size, or delivery approach, for example, predictive, hybrid, or adaptive. It describes the system within which projects operate, including governance, possible functions, the project environment, and considerations for the relationship between project management and product management.1\nPMI Seventh Edition July 20214\nThe Standard for Project Management1.2 KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS\nThe Standard for Project Management  reflects the progression of the profession. Organizations \nexpect projects to deliver outcomes in addition to outputs and artifacts. Project managers are \nexpected to deliver projects that create value for the organization and stakeholders within the organization’s system for value delivery. The following terms are defined to provide context for the content in this standard.\n▶Outcome. An end result or consequence of a process or project. Outcomes can includeoutputs and artifacts, but have a broader intent by focusing on the benefits and value thatthe project was undertaken to deliver.\n▶Portfolio.  Projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed as a group\nto achieve strategic objectives.\n▶Product. An artifact that is produced, is quantifiable, and can be either an end item in itselfor a component item.\n▶Program.  Related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities that are managed\nin a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually.\n▶Project.  A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.\nThe temporary nature of projects indicates a beginning and an end to the project work or\na phase of the project work. Projects can stand alone or be part of a program or portfolio.\n▶Project management.  The application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to\nproject activities to meet project requirements. Project management refers to guiding theproject work to deliver the intended outcomes. Project teams can achieve the outcomesusing a broad range of approaches (e.g., predictive, hybrid, and adaptive).\n▶Project manager.  The person assigned by the performing organization to lead the project\nteam that is responsible for achieving the project objectives. Project managers perform\na variety of functions, such as facilitating the project team work to achieve the outcomesand managing the processes to deliver intended outcomes. Additional functions areidentified in Section 2.3.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 20215\nSection 1 – Introduction▶Project team.  A set of individuals performing the work of the project to achieve\nits objectives.\n▶System for value delivery.  A collection of strategic business activities aimed at building,\nsustaining, and/or advancing an organization. Portfolios, programs, projects, products,\nand operations can all be part of an organization’s system for value delivery.\n▶Value. The worth, importance, or usefulness of something. Different stakeholders perceive\nvalue in different ways. Customers can define value as the ability to use specific featuresor functions of a product. Organizations can focus on business value as determined withfinancial metrics, such as the benefits less the cost of achieving those benefits. Societalvalue can include the contribution to groups of people, communities, or the environment.\nFor other terms used in this standard, refer to the Glossary and the PMI Lexicon of Project \nManagement Terms  [1].\n1\n1.3 AUDIENCE FOR THIS STANDARD\nThis standard provides a foundational reference for stakeholders participating in a project. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, project practitioners, consultants, educators, students, sponsors, stakeholders, and vendors who:\n▶Are responsible or accountable for delivering project outcomes;\n▶Work on projects full or part time;\n▶Work in portfolio, program, or project management offices (PMOs);\n▶Are involved in project sponsorship, product ownership, product management,\nexecutive leadership, or project governance;\n▶Are involved with portfolio or program management;\n▶Provide resources for project work;\n▶Focus on value delivery for portfolios, programs, and projects;\n▶Teach or study project management; and\n▶Are involved in any aspect of the project value delivery chain.\n1 The numbers in brackets refer to the list of references at the end of this standard.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021PMI Seventh Edition July 20217\nSection 2 – A System for Value DeliveryThe information in this section provides a context for value delivery, governance, project \nfunctions, the project environment, and product management.\n▶Section 2.1 Creating Value.  This section describes how projects operate within a system\nto produce value for organizations and their stakeholders.\n▶Section 2.2 Organizational Governance Systems.

This section describes how projects operate within a system\nto produce value for organizations and their stakeholders.\n▶Section 2.2 Organizational Governance Systems.  This section describes how governance\nsupports a system for value delivery.\n▶Section 2.3 Functions Associated with Projects.  This section identifies the functions\nthat support projects.\n▶Section 2.4 The Project Environment. This section identifies internal and external\nfactors that influence projects and the delivery of value.\n▶Section 2.5 Product Management Considerations.  This section identifies the ways\nportfolios, programs, projects, and products relate.\n2.1 CREATING VALUE\nProjects exist within a larger system, such as a governmental agency, organization, or contractual \narrangement. For the sake of brevity, this standard uses the term organization when referring to \ngovernment agencies, enterprises, contractual arrangements, joint ventures, and other arrangements. \nOrganizations create value for stakeholders. Examples of ways that projects produce value include, but are not limited to:A System for Value Delivery2\nPMI Seventh Edition July 20218\nThe Standard for Project Management▶Creating a new product, service, or result that meets the needs of customers or end users;\n▶Creating positive social or environmental contributions;\n▶Improving efficiency, productivity, effectiveness, or responsiveness;\n▶Enabling the changes needed to facilitate organizational transition to its desired future\nstate; and\n▶Sustaining benefits enabled by previous programs, projects, or business operations.\n2.1.1  VALUE DELIVERY COMPONENTS\nThere are various components, such as portfolios, programs, projects, products, and \noperations, that can be used individually and collectively to create value. Working together, these \ncomponents comprise a system for delivering value that is aligned with the organization’s strategy. Figure 2-1 shows an example of a system to deliver value that has two portfolios comprised of programs and projects. It also shows a stand-alone program with projects and stand-alone projects not associated with portfolios or programs. Any of the projects or programs could include products. Operations can directly support and influence portfolios, programs, and projects, as well as other business functions, such as payroll, supply chain management, and so forth. Portfolios, programs, and projects influence each other as well as operations.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 20219\nSection 2 – A System for Value DeliveryAs shown in Figure 2-2, a system for value delivery is part of an organization’s internal \nenvironment that is subject to policies, procedures, methodologies, frameworks, governance \nstructures, and so forth. That internal environment exists within the larger external environment, which includes the economy, the competitive environment, legislative constraints, etc. Section 2.4 provides more detail on internal and external environments.System for Va lue Deliver y\nOperationsProgram A.1Portfolio A\nProgram A.2\nProjectsPortfolio B\nProgram B.1\nProjectsProjectsProgram N.1\nProjectsProjects\nFigure 2-1. Example of a System for Value Delivery\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202110\nThe Standard for Project ManagementThe components in a value delivery system create deliverables used to produce outcomes. An \noutcome is the end result or consequence of a process or a project. Focusing on outcomes, choices, \nand decisions emphasizes the long-range performance of the project. The outcomes create benefits, which are gains realized by the organization. Benefits, in turn, create value, which is something of worth, importance, or usefulness.Exter nal En vironment\nInternal En vironment\nSystem for Value Deliver y\nOperationsProgram A.1Portfolio A\nProgram A.2\nProjectsPortfolio B\nProgram B.1\nProjectsProjectsProgram N.1\nProjectsProjects\nFigure 2-2. Components of a Sample System for Value Delivery\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202111\nSection 2 – A System for Value Delivery2.1.2  INFORMATION FLOW\nA value delivery system works most effectively when information and feedback are shared \nconsistently among all components, keeping the system aligned with strategy and attuned to  \nthe environment.\nFigure 2-3 shows a model of the flow of information where black arrows represent information \nfrom senior leadership to portfolios, portfolios to programs and projects, and then to operations. \nSenior leadership shares strategic information with portfolios. Portfolios share the desired outcomes, benefits, and value with programs and projects. Deliverables from programs and projects are passed on to operations along with information on support and maintenance for the deliverables.\nThe light gray arrows in Figure 2-3 represent the reverse flow of information. Information \nfrom operations to programs and projects suggests adjustments, fixes, and updates to deliverables. Programs and projects provide performance information and progress on achieving the desired outcomes, benefits, and value to portfolios. Portfolios provide evaluations on portfolio performance with senior leadership. Additionally, operations provide information on how well the organization’s strategy is advancing.\nPortfolio performance\ninformationPerformance information\nand progress\nOutcomes, Benefits,  Value Performance AnalysisStrategyDesired outcomes,\nbenefits, and va lue\nInformation for updates,\nfixes, and adjustmentsDeliverables with support\nand maintenance information\nSenior\nLeadershipPortfoliosPrograms\nand ProjectsOperations\nFigure 2-3.

Gov ernance systems prov ide a framework with functions \nand processes that guide activ ities. A governance framework can i nclude elements o f oversight, control, \nvalue assessment, integration among components, and decision-making capabilities.\nGovernance systems provide an integrated structure for evaluating changes, issues, and risks \nassociated with the environment and any component in the value delivery system. This includes \nportfolio objectives, program benefits, and deliverables produced by projects.\nProjects can ope rate within a program or portfolio or as a stand-alone activity. In some \norganizations, a project management office might support programs  and projects withi n a \nportfolio. Project governance inc ludes  defining the  authority to appro ve changes and make other \nbusiness decisio ns related to the project. Project governance is  aligned with program and/or \norganizational governance.\n2.3 FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PR OJE CTS\nPeople drive project delivery. They do so by fulfilling functions necessary for the project to run \neffectively and efficiently. Functions related to the project can be fulfilled by one person, by a group \nof people, or combined into defined roles.\nCoordinating a collective work effort is extremely important to the success of any project. \nThere are different types of coordination suitable for different contexts. Some projects benefit from \ndecentralized coordination in which project team members self-organize and self-manage. Other \nprojects benefit from centralized coordination with the leadership and guidance of a designated \nproject manager or similar role. Some projects with centralized coordination can also bene fit from \nincluding self-organized project teams for portions of the work. Regardless of how coordination takes \nplace, supportive leadership models and meaningful, continuous engagements between project \nteams and other stakeholders underpin successful outcomes.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202113\nSection 2 – A System for Value DeliveryRegardless of how projects are coordinated, the collective effort of the project team delivers the \noutcomes, benefits, and value. The project team may be supported by additional functions depending \non the deliverables, industry, organization, and other variables. Sections 2.3.1 through 2.3.8 provide examples of functions that are often found on projects, though these are not a comprehensive list. In addition to these functions, other functions may be necessary to enable project deliverables that produce the desired outcomes. The needs of the project, organization, and environment influence which functions are used on a project and how those functions are carried out.\n2.3.1  PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND COORDINATION\nPeople in this function help the project team achieve the project objectives, typically by \norchestrating the work of the project. The specifics of how this function is carried out within the project team can vary among organizations, but can include leading the planning, monitoring, and controlling activities. In some organizations, this function may involve some evaluation and analysis activities as part of pre-project activities. This function includes monitoring and working to improve the health, safety, and overall well-being of project team members.\nCoordination includes consulting with executive and business unit leaders on ideas for advancing \nobjectives, improving project performance, or meeting customer needs. It can also include assisting in business analysis, tendering and contract negotiations, and business case development.\nOversight can be involved in follow-on activities related to benefits realization and sustainment \nafter the project deliverables are finalized but before formal closure of the project. This function can support portfolios and programs within which the project is initiated. Ultimately, the function is tailored to fit the organization.\n2.3.2  PRESENT OBJECTIVES AND FEEDBACK\nPeople in this function contribute perspectives, insights, and clear direction from customers and \nend users. The customer and end user are not always synonymous. For the purpose of this standard, the customer is defined as the individual or group who has requested or is funding the project. The end user is the individual or group who will experience the direct use of the project deliverable.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202114\nThe Standard for Project ManagementProjects need clear direction from customers and end users regarding project requirements, \noutcomes, and expectations. In adaptive and hybrid project environments, the need for ongoing \nfeedback is greater because the project teams are exploring and developing product elements within \nspecific increments. In some project environments, the customer or end user engages with the \nproject team for periodic review and feedback. In some projects, a representative of the customer \nor client participates on the project team. The customer and end user input and feedback needs are \ndetermined by the nature of the project and the guidance or direction required.\n2.3.3  FACILI TATE AND SUPPORT\nThe function of facilitation and support may be closely related to providing oversight and \ncoordination, depending on the nature of the project. The work involves encouraging project team \nmember participation, collaboration, and a shared sense of responsibility for the work output. \nFacilitation helps the project team create consensus around solutions, resolve con flicts, and make \ndecisions. Facilitation is also required to coordinate meetings and contribute in an unbiased way  \nto the advancement of project objectives.\nSupporting people through change and helping address obstacles that can prevent success is \nalso required. This can include evaluating performance and providing individuals and project teams \nwith feedback to help them learn, adapt, and improve.\n2.3.4  PERFORM WORK AND CONTRIBU TE INSI GHTS",

This can include evaluating performance and providing individuals and project teams \nwith feedback to help them learn, adapt, and improve.\n2.3.4  PERFORM WORK AND CONTRIBU TE INSI GHTS\nThis group of people provides the knowledge, skills, and experience necessary to produce the \nproducts and realize the outcomes of the project. Work can be full time or part time for the duration \nof the project or for a limited period, and the work can be colocated or virtual, depending on the \nenvironmental factors. Some work can be highly specialized, while other work can be done by project \nteam members who have broad skill sets.\nGaining insights from cross-functional project team members representing di fferent parts of \nthe organization can provide a mix of internal perspectives, establish alliances with key business \nunits, and encourage project team members to act as change agents within their functional areas. \nThis work can extend into support functions (during or after the project) as the project deliverables \nare implemented or transitioned into operations.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202115\nSection 2 – A System for Value Delivery2.3.5  APPLY EXPERTISE\nPeople in this function provide the knowledge, vision, and expertise in a specific subject for  \na project. They offer advice and support throughout the organization, and contribute to the project \nteam’s learning process and work accuracy. These people can be external to the organization  \nor can be internal project team members. They can be required for the whole project or during  \na specific time frame.\n2.3.6  PROVIDE BUSINESS DIRECTION AND INSIGHT\nPeople in this function guide and clarify the direction of the project or product outcome. \nThis function involves prioritizing the requirements or backlog items based on business value, dependencies, and technical or operational risk. People in this function provide feedback to project teams and set direction for the next increment or element to be developed or delivered. The function involves interacting with other stakeholders, customers, and their project teams to define the product direction. The goal is to maximize the value of the project deliverable.\nIn adaptive and hybrid environments, direction and insight can be provided using a specific \ncadence. In predictive environments, there can be designated checkpoints for presentation of and feedback on project progress. In some instances, business direction can interact with funding and resourcing functions.\n2.3.7  PROVIDE RESOURCES AND DIRECTION\nPeople in this function promote the project and communicate the organization’s vision, goals, \nand expectations to the project team and broader stakeholder community. They advocate for the project and the project team by helping to secure the decisions, resources, and authority that allow project activities to progress.\nPeople in this function serve as liaisons between senior management and the project team, \nplay a supporting role in keeping projects aligned to business objectives, remove obstacles, and address issues outside the bounds of the project team’s decision authority. People in this function provide an escalation path for problems, issues, or risks that project teams cannot resolve or manage on their own, such as a shortage of funding or other resources, or deadlines that cannot be met.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202116\nThe Standard for Project ManagementThis function can facilitate innovation by identifying opportunities that arise within the project \nand communicating these to senior management. People in this function may monitor project \noutcomes after project closure to ensure the intended business bene fits are realized.\n2.3.8  MAINTAIN GOVERNANCE\nPeople who fill a governance function approve and support recommendations made by \nthe project team and monitor project progress in achieving the desired outcomes. They maintain \nlinkages between project teams and strategic or business objectives that can change over the course \nof the project.\n2.4 THE PROJECT ENVIRONMENT\nProjects exist and operate within internal and external environments that have varying degrees \nof influence on value delivery. Internal and external environments can influence planning and other \nproject activities. These influences can yield a favorable, unfavorable, or neutral impact on project \ncharacteristics, stakeholders, or project teams.\n2.4.1  INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT\nFactors internal to the organization can arise from the organization itself, a portfolio, a \nprogram, another project, or a combination of these. They include artifacts, practices, or internal \nknowledge. Knowledge includes lessons learned as well as completed artifacts from previous \nprojects. Examples include but are not limited to:\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202117\nSection 2 – A System for Value Delivery▶Process assets.  Process assets may include tools, methodologies, approaches, templates,\nframeworks, patterns, or PMO resources.\n▶Governance documentation.  This documentation includes policies and processes.\n▶Data assets.  Data assets may include databases, document libraries, metrics, data, and\nartifacts from previous projects.\n▶Knowledge assets.  Knowledge assets may include tacit knowledge among project team\nmembers, subject matter experts, and other employees.\n▶Security and safety. Security and safety measures may include procedures and practices\nfor facility access, data protection, levels of confidentiality, and proprietary secrets.\n▶Organizational culture, structure, and governance.  These aspects of an organization\ninclude the vision, mission, values, beliefs, cultural norms, leadership style, hierarchy andauthority relationships, organizational style, ethics, and code of conduct.\n▶Geographic distribution of facilities and resources.

Examples include scheduling software, configuration\nmanagement systems, web interfaces to online automated systems, collaboration tools,and work authorization systems.\n▶Resource availability.  Examples include contracting and purchasing constraints, approved\nproviders and subcontractors, and collaboration agreements. Availability related to bothpeople and materials includes contracting and purchasing constraints, approved providersand subcontractors, and time lines.\n▶Employee capability.  Examples include general and specialized expertise, skills,\ncompetencies, techniques, and knowledge.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202118\nThe Standard for Project Management2.4.2  EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT\nFactors external to the organization can enhance, constrain, or have a neutral influence on \nproject outcomes. Examples include but are not limited to:\n▶Marketplace conditions.  Marketplace conditions include competitors, market share,\nbrand recognition, technology trends, and trademarks.\n▶Social and cultural influences and issues.  These factors include political climate,\nregional customs and traditions, public holidays and events, codes of conduct, ethics,\nand perceptions.\n▶Regulatory environment.  The regulatory environment may include national and regional\nlaws and regulations related to security, data protection, business conduct, employment,\nlicensing, and procurement.\n▶Commercial databases.  Databases include standardized cost estimating data and\nindustry risk study information.\n▶Academic research.  This research can include industry studies, publications, and\nbenchmarking results.\n▶Industry standards.  These standards are related to products, production, environment,\nquality, and workmanship.\n▶Financial considerations.  These considerations include currency exchange rates,\ninterest rates, inflation, taxes, and tariffs.\n▶Physical environment.  The physical environment pertains to working conditions\nand weather.\n2.5 PRODUCT MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS\nThe disciplines of portfolio, program, project, and product management are becoming more \ninterlinked. While portfolio, program, and product management are beyond the scope of this standard, understanding each discipline and the relationships between them provides a useful context for projects whose deliverables are products.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202119\nSection 2 – A System for Value DeliveryA product is an artifact that is produced, is quantifiable, and can be either an end item itself \nor a component item. Product management involves the integration of people, data, processes, and \nbusiness systems to create, maintain, and develop a product or service throughout its life cycle. The product life cycle is a series of phases that represents the evolution of a product, from introduction through growth, maturity, and to retirement.\nProduct management may initiate programs or projects at any point in the product life cycle to \ncreate or enhance specific components, functions, or capabilities (see Figure 2-4). The initial product may begin as a deliverable of a program or project. Throughout its life cycle, a new program or project may add or improve specific components, attributes, or capabilities that create additional value for customers and the sponsoring organization. In some instances, a program can encompass the full life cycle of a product or service to manage the benefits and create value for the organization more directly.\nIntroduction Growth Maturity Decline/RetirementProject Usage, Sales, Impact\nTimeProject 3\n(Additions)\nProject 7\n(Retirement)Project 1\n(Initial Creation)Project 4\n(Revisions)\nProject 5\n(Revisions)\nProject 6\n(Revisions)Project 2\n(More Features)Program A Program BPortfolio Governance\nProduct\nLife Cycle\nPhases:\nFigure 2-4. Sample Product Life Cycle\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202120\nThe Standard for Project ManagementProduct management can exist in different forms, including but not limited to:\n▶Program management within a product life cycle.  This approach incorporates related\nprojects, subsidiary programs, and program activities. For very large or long-running\nproducts, one or more product life cycle phases may be sufficiently complex to merit a setof programs and projects working together.\n▶Project management within a product life cycle.  This approach oversees development\nand maturing of product capabilities as an ongoing business activity. Portfolio governancecharters individual projects as needed to perform enhancements and improvements or toproduce other unique outcomes.\n▶Product management within a program.  This approach applies the full product life cycle\nwithin the purview and boundaries of a given program. A series of subsidiary programsor projects will be chartered to achieve specific benefits for a product. Those benefits canbe enhanced by applying product management competencies like competitive analysis,customer acquisition, and customer advocacy.\nWhile product management is a separate discipline with its own body of knowledge,  \nit represents a key integration point within the program management and project management disciplines. Programs and projects with deliverables that include products use a tailored and integrated approach that incorporates all of the relevant bodies of knowledge and their related practices, methods, and artifacts.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202121\nSection 3 – Project Management PrinciplesPrinciples for a profession serve as foundational guidelines for strategy, decision making, and \nproblem solving. Professional standards and methodologies are often based on principles. In some \nprofessions, principles serve as laws or rules, and are therefore prescriptive in nature. The principles of project management are not prescriptive in nature. They are intended to guide the behavior of  \npeople involved in projects. They are broadly based so there are many ways individuals and organizations can maintain alignment with the principles.\nPrinciples can, but do not necessarily, reflect morals. A",

They are intended to guide the behavior of  \npeople involved in projects. They are broadly based so there are many ways individuals and organizations can maintain alignment with the principles.\nPrinciples can, but do not necessarily, reflect morals. A code of ethics is related to morals. \nA code of ethics for a profession can be adopted by an individual or profession to establish expectations for moral conduct. The PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  [2] is based on  \nfour values that were identified as most important to the project management community:\n▶Responsibility,\n▶Respect,\n▶Fairness, and\n▶Honesty.\nThe 12 principles of project management are aligned with the values identified in the PMI Code \nof Ethics and Professional Conduct.  They do not follow the same format, and they are not duplicative, \nrather the principles and the Code of Ethics  are complementary.\nThe principles of project management were identified and developed by engaging a global \ncommunity of project practitioners. The practitioners represent different industries, cultural backgrounds, and organizations in different roles and with experience in various types of projects. Multiple rounds of feedback resulted in 12 principles that provide guidance for effective project management.Project Management \nPrinciples3\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202122\nThe Standard for Project ManagementBecause the principles of project management provide guidance, the degree of application \nand the way in which they are applied are influenced by the context of the organization, project, \ndeliverables, project team, stakeholders, and other factors. The principles are internally consistent, meaning that no principle contradicts any other principle. However, in practice there may be times when the principles can overlap. For example, guidance for navigating complexity can present information that is useful in recognizing, evaluating, and responding to system interactions or optimizing risk responses.\nPrinciples of project management can also have areas of overlap with general management \nprinciples. For example, both projects and business in general focus on delivering value. The methods may be somewhat different in projects as opposed to operations, but the underlying principle associated with focusing on value can apply to both. Figure 3-1 demonstrates this overlap.\nProject\nManagement\nPrinciplesGeneral\nManagement\nPrinciples\nFigure 3-1. Overlap of Project Management and General Management Principles\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202123\nSection 3 – Project Management PrinciplesThe principle labels are listed here without any specific weighting or order. The principle \nstatements are presented and described in Sections 3.1 through 3.12. Each section begins with a \nfigure that provides the principle label across the top with the principle and key points under the label. Following the figure, each principle is elaborated in the text. The principle labels are:\n▶Be a diligent, respectful, and caring steward (see Section 3.1).\n▶Create a collaborative project team environment (see Section 3.2).\n▶Effectively engage with stakeholders (see Section 3.3).\n▶Focus on value (see Section 3.4).\n▶Recognize, evaluate, and respond to system interactions (see Section 3.5).\n▶Demonstrate leadership behaviors (see Section 3.6).\n▶Tailor based on context (see Section 3.7).\n▶Build quality into processes and deliverables (see Section 3.8).\n▶Navigate complexity (see Section 3.9).\n▶Optimize risk responses (see Section 3.10).\n▶Embrace adaptability and resiliency (see Section 3.11).\n▶Enable change to achieve the envisioned future state (see Section 3.12).\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202124\nThe Standard for Project Management3.1 BE A DILIGENT, RESPECTFUL, AND CARING STEWARD\nSTEWARDSHIP\nStewards act responsibly \nto car ry out activities \nwith integrity , care, and \ntrustwor thiness while \nmaintaining compliance with internal and exter nal \nguidelines.

Be a Diligent, Respectful, and Caring Steward\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202125\nSection 3 – Project Management PrinciplesStewardship has slightly different meanings and applications in different contexts. One aspect \nof stewardship involves being entrusted with the care of something. Another aspect focuses on the \nresponsible planning, use, and management of resources. Yet another aspect means upholding values and ethics.\nStewardship encompasses responsibilities both within and external to the organization. Within \nthe organization, stewardship includes:\n▶Operating in alignment with the organization, its objectives, strategy, vision, mission,\nand sustainment of its long-term value;\n▶Commitment to and respectful engagement of project team members, including their\ncompensation, access to opportunity, and fair treatment;\n▶Diligent oversight of organizational finances, materials, and other resources used within\na project; and\n▶Understanding the appropriate use of authority, accountability, and responsibility,\nparticularly in leadership positions.\nStewardship outside the organization includes responsibilities in areas such as:\n▶Environmental sustainability and the organization’s use of materials and natural resources;\n▶Organization’s relationship with external stakeholders such as its partners and channels;\n▶Impact of the organization or project on the market, social community,",

Stewards also adhere to both implicit and explicit duties. These can include the following:\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202126\nThe Standard for Project Management▶Integrity. Stewards behave honestly and ethically in all engagements and communications.\nStewards hold themselves to the highest standards and reflect the values, principles, andbehaviors expected of those in their organization. Stewards serve as role models, buildingtrust by living and demonstrating personal and organizational values in their engagements,work activities, and decisions. In the project management context, this duty often requiresstewards to challenge team members, peers, and other stakeholders to consider theirwords and actions; and to be empathetic, self-reflective, and open to feedback.\n▶Care. Stewards are fiduciaries of the organizational matters in their charge, and theydiligently oversee them. Higher-performing projects feature professionals who diligentlyoversee those matters, beyond the confines of strictly defined responsibilities. Stewardspay close attention and exercise the same level of care over those matters as they wouldfor their personal matters. Care relates to the internal business affairs of the organization.Care for the environment, sustainable use of natural resources, and concern for theconditions of people across the planet should be reflected in the organizational policiesand principles.\nProjects bring about changes that may have unanticipated or unwanted consequences.\nProject practitioners should identify, analyze, and manage the potential downsides ofproject outcomes so that stakeholders are aware and informed.\nCare includes creating a transparent working environment, open communication channels,\nand opportunities for stakeholders to raise concerns without penalty or fear of retribution.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202127\nSection 3 – Project Management Principles▶Trustworthiness.  Stewards represent themselves, their roles, their project team, and\ntheir authority accurately, both inside and outside of the organization. This behavior\nallows people to understand the degree to which an individual can commit resources,make decisions, or approve something. Trustworthiness also entails individuals proactivelyidentifying conflicts between their personal interests and those of their organization orclients. Such conflicts can undermine trust and confidence, result in unethical or illegalbehaviors, create confusion, or contribute to suboptimal outcomes. Stewards protectprojects from such breaches of trust.\n▶Compliance.  Stewards comply with laws, rules, regulations, and requirements that are\nproperly authorized within or outside of their organization. However, high-performingprojects seek ways to integrate compliance more fully into the project culture, creatingmore alignment with diverse and potentially conflicting guidelines. Stewards strive forcompliance with guidelines intended to protect them, their organization, their stakeholders,and the public at large. In instances where stewards face conflicting guidelines or questionsregarding whether or not actions or plans align with established guidelines, stewards seekappropriate counsel and direction.\nStewardship requires leadership with transparency and trustworthiness. Projects affect the \nlives of the people who deliver them as well as those who are affected by the project deliverables  \nand outcomes. Projects can have effects, such as easing traffic congestion, producing new medications, or creating opportunities for people to interact. Those effects can produce negative impacts and consequences, such as reduced green space, side effects from medications, or disclosure of personal information. Project teams and their organizational leaders carefully consider such factors and impacts so they can make responsible decisions by balancing organizational and project objectives with the larger needs and expectations of global stakeholders.\nIncreasingly, organizations are taking a holistic view to business that considers financial, \ntechnical, social, and environmental performance simultaneously instead of sequentially. Since the world is interconnected now more than ever and has finite resources and a shared environment, stewardship decisions have ramifications beyond the project.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202128\nThe Standard for Project Management3.2 CREATE A COLLABORATIVE PROJECT TEAM ENVIRONMENT\nCreating a collaborative project team environment involves multiple contributing factors, \nsuch as team agreements, structures, and processes. These factors support a culture that enables \nindividuals to work together and provide synergistic effects from interactions.TEAM\nProject teams are made \nup of individuals who wield diverse skills,  \nknowledge,  and experi-\nence. Project teams that work collaboratively can \naccomplish a shared objective more eff ectively \nand efficiently than individuals working on their own.Projects are delive red by project teams.\nProject teams work within organizational and professional  \ncultures and guidelines, often establishing their ow n “local” \nculture.\nA collaborative project team environment facilitates:\n•Alignment with other orga nizational cultures and guidelines,\n•Individual and team learning and de velopment, and\n•Optimal contributions to deliver desired outcomes.\nFigure 3-3.

An authority figure may formally impose a structure, or project teammembers may contribute to its design in alignment with organizational structures.\nExamples of organizational structures that can improve collaboration include, but are not\nlimited to:\n▹Definitions of roles and responsibilities,\n▹Allocation of employees and vendors into project teams,\n▹Formal committees tasked with a specific objective, and\n▹Standing meetings that regularly review a given topic.\n▶Processes.

For example, project teams may agree to a decomposition process using\na work breakdown structure (WBS), backlog, or task board.\nProject teams are influenced by the culture of the organizations involved in the project, the \nnature of the project, and the environment in which they operate. Within these influences, project teams establish their own team cultures. Project teams can tailor their structure to best accomplish the project objective.\nBy fostering inclusive and collaborative environments, knowledge and expertise are more freely \nexchanged, which in turn enable better project outcomes.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202130\nThe Standard for Project ManagementClarity on roles and responsibilities can improve team cultures. Within project teams, specific \ntasks may be delegated to individuals or selected by project team members themselves. This includes \nthe authority, accountability, and responsibility related to tasks:\n▶Authority. The condition of having the right, within a given context, to make relevantdecisions, establish or improve procedures, apply project resources, expend funds, or\ngive approvals. Authority is conferred from one entity to another, whether done explicitly\nor implicitly.\n▶Accountability.  The condition of being answerable for an outcome. Accountability\nis not shared.\n▶Responsibility.  The condition of being obligated to do or fulfill something. Responsibility\ncan be shared.\nRegardless of who is accountable or responsible for specific project work, a collaborative \nproject team takes collective ownership of the project outcomes.\nA diverse project team can enrich the project environment by bringing together di fferent \nperspectives. The project team can be comprised of internal organizational sta ff, contracted \ncontributors, volunteers, or external third parties. Additionally, some project team members join the \nproject on a short-term basis to work on a specific deliverable while other members are assigned to \nthe project on a longer-term basis. Integrating these individuals with a project team can challenge \neveryone involved. A team culture of respect allows for differences and finds ways to leverage them \nproductively, encouraging effective conflict management.\nAnother aspect of a collaborative project team environment is the incorporation of practice \nstandards, ethical codes, and other guidelines that are part of the professional work within the \nproject team and the organization. Project teams consider how the se guides can support their efforts \nto avoid possible conflict among the disciplines and the established guidelines they use.\nA collaborative project team environment fosters  the free exchange  of information and individual \nknowledge. This, in turn, increases shared learning and individual development while delivering \noutcomes. A collaborative pro ject team environment enables ev eryone to contribute their best \nefforts to deliver the desired outcomes for an organization. The organization, in turn, will benefit from \ndeliverables and outcomes that re spect and enhance its fundament al values, principles, and culture .\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202131\nSection 3 – Project Management Principles3.3 EFFECTIVELY ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS\nStakeholders can be individuals, groups, or organizations that may affect, be affected by,  \nor perceive themselves to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a portfolio, program, or \nproject.

Additionally, the degree \nof a stakeholder’s interest, influence, or impact may change over time. Stakeholders, especially those with a high degree of influence and who have an unfavorable or neutral view about a project, need to be effectively engaged so that their interests, concerns, and rights are understood. The project team can then address these concerns through effective engagement and support leading to the probability of a successful project outcome.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202133\nSection 3 – Project Management PrinciplesIdentifying, analyzing, and proactively engaging with stakeholders from the start to the end \nof the project helps to enable success.\nProject teams are a group of stakeholders. This group of stakeholders engages other \nstakeholders to understand, consider, communicate, and respond to their interests, needs, \nand opinions.\nEffective and efficient engagement and communication include determining how, when, \nhow often, and under what circumstances stakeholders want to be—and should be—engaged. \nCommunication is a key part of engagement; however, engagement delves deeper to include awareness of the ideas of others, assimilation of other perspectives, and collective shaping of a shared\n \nsolution. Engagement includes building and maintaining solid relationships through frequent, two-way communication. It encourages collaboration through interactive meetings, face-to-face meetings, informal dialogue, and knowledge-sharing activities.\nStakeholder engagement relies heavily on interpersonal skills, including taking initiative, \nintegrity, honesty, collaboration, respect, empathy, and confidence. These skills and attitudes can help everyone adapt to the work and to each other, increasing the likelihood of success.\nEngagement helps project teams detect, collect, and evaluate information, data, and opinions. \nThis creates shared understanding and alignment, which enables project outcomes. Additionally, these activities help the project team to tailor the project to identify, adjust, and respond to changing circumstances.\nProject teams actively engage other stakeholders throughout the project to minimize potential \nnegative impacts and maximize positive impacts. Stakeholder engagements also enable opportunities for stronger project performance and outcomes in addition to increasing stakeholder satisfaction. Finally, engaging other stakeholders helps the project team to find solutions that may be more acceptable to a broader range of stakeholders.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202134\nThe Standard for Project Management3.4 FOCUS ON VALUE\nVALUE\nContinually evaluate and \nadjust project alignment to business objectives and intended benefits and value.Value is the ultimate indicator of project success.\nValue can be realized throughout the project, at the end of \nthe project, or after the project is complete.\nValue, and the benefits that contribute to value, can be \ndefined in quantitative  and/or qualitative  terms.\nA focus on outcomes allows project teams to support the \nintended benefits that lead to va lue creation.\nProject teams ev aluate progress and adapt to maximize the  \nexpected value.\nFigure 3-5. Focus on Value\nValue, including outcomes from the perspective of the customer or end user, is the ultimate \nsuccess indicator and driver of projects. Value focuses on the outcome of the deliverables. The value \nof a project may be expressed as a financial contribution to the sponsoring or receiving organization. \nValue may be a measure of public good achieved, for example, social bene fit or the customer’s \nperceived benefit from the project result. When the project is a component of a program, the \nproject’s contribution to program outcomes can represent value.\nMany projects, tho ugh not all, are  initiated based on a business case. Projects may be \ninitiated due t o any identified ne ed to deliver o r mo dify a process, product, or service, such as \ncontracts, statements of work, o r other documents. In all cases, t he project intent is to provide \nthe desired outcome that addresse s the need with a valued solution. A business case  can contain \ninformation about  strategic alignment, assessment of risk exposure , economic feasibility study, \nreturn on investme nts, expected key performance measures, evaluations, and alternative \napproaches.

Project justification is connected to business need. It explains why\nthe business need is worth the investment and why it should be addressed at this time.\nThe project justification is accompanied by a cost-benefit analysis and assumptions.\n▶Business strategy.  Business strategy is the reason for the project and all needs are\nrelated to the strategy to achieve the value.\nTogether, the business need, project justification, and business strategy, in addition to benefits \nand possible agreements, provide the project team with information that allows them to make informed decisions to meet or exceed the intended business value.\nDesired outcomes should be clearly described, iteratively assessed, and updated throughout \nthe project. During its life cycle, a project may undergo change and the project team then adapts in response. The project team continuously evaluates project progress and direction against the desired outputs, baselines, and business case to confirm that the project remains aligned to the need and will deliver its intended outcomes. Alternatively, the business case is updated to capture an opportunity or minimize a problem identified by the project team and other stakeholders. If the project or its stakeholders are no longer aligned with the business need or if the project seems unlikely to provide the intended value, the organization may choose to terminate the effort.\nValue is the worth, importance, or usefulness of something. Value is subjective, in the sense \nthat the same concept can have different values for different people and organizations. This occurs because what is considered a benefit depends on organizational strategies, ranging from short-term financial gains, long-term gains, and even nonfinancial elements. Because all projects have a range of stakeholders, different values generated for each group of stakeholders have to be considered and balanced with the whole, while placing a priority on the customer perspective.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202136\nThe Standard for Project ManagementWithin the context of some projects, there may be different forms of value engineering that \nmaximize value to the customer, to the performing organization, or other stakeholders. An example \nof this includes delivering the required functionality and level of quality with an acceptable risk \nexposure, while using as few resources as possible, and by avoiding waste. Sometimes, especially in \nadaptive projects that do not have a fixed, up-front scope, the project team can optimize value by \nworking with the customer to determine which features are worth investment and which may not be \nvaluable enough to be added to the output.\nTo support value realization from proj ects, project teams shift fo cus from deliverables to \nthe intended outcomes. Doing so allows project teams to deliver o n the vision or purpose of the  \nproject, rather than simply creating a specific deliverable . While the deliverable may support \nthe intended project outcome, it  may not fully achieve the visio n or purpose of the project. For \nexample, customers may want a specific software solution because they think that the solution \nresolves the business need for higher productivity. The soft ware is  the output of the project , but \nthe software itself does not enable the productivity outcome that i s intended. In this case, adding a \nnew deliverable of training and coaching on the use of the so ftware can enable a better productivit y \noutcome. If the project’s out put fails to enable higher producti vity, stakeholders may fee l that the \nproject has failed. Thus, proje ct teams and other stakeholders  understand both the deliverable and \nthe intended outcome from the deli verable .\nThe value contribution of project work could be a short- or long-term measure. Because value \ncontribution may be mixed with contributions from operational activities, it may be di fficult to isolate. \nWhen the project is a component of a program, evaluation of value at the program level may also \nbe necessary to properly direct the project. A reliable evaluation of value should consider the whole \ncontext and the entire life cycle of the project’s output. While value is realized over time, e ffective \nprocesses can enable early benefit realization. With efficient and effective implementation, project \nteams may demonstrate or achieve such outcomes as prioritized delivery, better customer service, \nor an improved work environment. By working with organizational leaders who are responsible \nfor putting project deliverables into use, project leaders can make sure that the deliverables are \npositioned to realize the planned outcomes.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202137\nSection 3 – Project Management Principles3.5  RECOGNIZE, EVALUATE, AND RESPOND TO SYSTEM \nINTERACTIONS\nA system is a set of interacting and interdependent components that function as a unified \nwhole. Taking a holistic view, a project is a multifaceted entity that exists in dynamic circumstances, \nexhibiting the characteristics of a system. Project teams should acknowledge this holistic view of  \na project, seeing the project as a system with its own working parts.\nA project works within other larger systems, and a project deliverable may become part of \na larger system to realize benefits. For example, projects may be part of a program which, in turn, may also be part of a portfolio. These interconnected structures are known as a system of systems . \nProject teams balance inside/out and outside/in perspectives to support alignment across the system of systems.\nThe project may also have subsystems that are required to integrate effectively to deliver the \nintended outcome.

This requires project teams to interact and align subsystem work on a regular basis.Recognize,  evaluate, and \nrespond to the dynamic \ncircumstances within and surrounding the project in a holistic way to positively affect project performance.SYSTEMS THINKING\nA project is a system of interdependent and interacting  \ndomains of activity .\nSystems thinking entails taking a holistic view of how project \nparts interact with each other and with external systems.\nSystems are constantly changing , requiring consistent attention  \nto internal and external conditions.\nBeing responsive  to system interactions allows project teams to \nleverag e positive outcomes.\nFigure 3-6. Recognize, Evaluate, and Respond to System Interactions\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202138\nThe Standard for Project ManagementSystems thinking also considers timing elements of systems, such as what the project delivers \nor enables over time. For example, if project deliverables are released incrementally, each increment \nexpands the cumulative outcomes or capabilities of previous versions. Project teams should think \nbeyond the end of the project to the operational state of the project’s deliverable, so that intended \noutcomes are realized.\nAs projects unfold, internal and external conditions are continuo usly changing. A single change  \ncan create several impacts. For example, on a large construction project, a change in requirements can \ncause contractual changes with the primary contractor, subcontract ors, suppliers, or others. In t urn, \nthose changes can create an impact on project cost, schedule, sco pe, and performance. Subsequently, \nthese changes could invoke a change control protocol for obt aining approvals from entities in external \nsystems, such as the service providers, regulators, financiers, and government authorities.\nWhile it is possible to predict some of the changes in advance, many of the changes that can \nimpact the project during its life cycle emerge in real time. With systems thinking, including constant \nattention to internal and external conditions, the project team can navigate a wide spectrum of \nchanges and impacts to keep the project in agreement with the relevant stakeholders.\nSystems thinking also applies to how the project team views itself and its interactions within \nthe project system. The project system often brings together a diverse project team engaged in \nworking for a common objective. This diversity brings value to project teams, but they need to \nconsider how to leverage those differences e ffectively, so that the project team works cohesively. \nFor example, if a government agency contracts with a private company for development of a new \ntechnology, the development team may consist of project team members from both organizations. \nThose project team members may have assumptions, ways of working, and mental models related \nto how they function within their home organization. In this new project system, which combines the \ncultures of a private company and a government agency, the project team members can establish a \nsynthesized team culture that creates a common vision, language, and toolset. This can help project \nteam members to engage and contribute effectively and help to increase the probability that the \nproject system works.\nBecause of the interactivity among systems, project teams should operate with awareness of, \nand vigilance toward, changing system dynamics. The following skills support a systems view  \nof the project:\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202139\nSection 3 – Project Management Principles▶Empathy with the business areas;\n▶Critical thinking with a big picture focus;\n▶Challenging of assumptions and mental models;\n▶Seeking external review and advice;\n▶Use of integrated methods, artifacts, and practices so there is a common understanding\nof project work, deliverables, and outcomes;\n▶Use of modeling and scenarios to envision how system dynamics may interact\nand react; and\n▶Proactive management of the integration to help achieve business outcomes.\nRecognizing, evaluating, and responding to system interactions can lead to the following \npositive outcomes:\n▶Early consideration of uncertainty and risk within the project, exploration of alternatives,\nand consideration of unintended consequences;\n▶Ability to adjust assumptions and plans throughout the project life cycle;\n▶Provision of ongoing information and insights that inform planning and delivery;\n▶Clear communication of plans, progress, and projections to relevant stakeholders;\n▶Alignment of project goals and objectives to the customer organization’s goals,\nobjectives, and vision;\n▶Ability to adjust to the changing needs of the end user, sponsor, or customer\nof the project deliverables;\n▶Ability to see synergies and savings between aligned projects or initiatives;\n▶Ability to exploit opportunities not otherwise captured or see threats posed to\nor by other projects or initiatives;\n▶Clarity regarding the best project performance measurement and their influence\non the behavior of the people involved in the project;\n▶Decisions that benefit the organization as a whole; and\n▶More comprehensive and informed identification of risks.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202140\nThe Standard for Project Management3.6 DEMONSTRATE LEADERSHIP BEHAVIORS\nLEADERSHIP\nEffectiv e leadership promotes project success and contributes  \nto positive project outcomes.\nAny project team member can demonstrate leadership  \nbehaviors.Leadership is different than authority .\nEffectiv e leaders adapt their style to the situation .\nEffectiv e leaders recognize differences in motivation among \nproject team members.Leaders demonstrate desired behavior in areas of honesty , \nintegrity,  and ethical conduct.Demonstrate and adapt \nleader ship behaviors to \nsuppor t individual and \nteam needs.",

Demonstrate Leadership Behaviors\nProjects create a unique need for effective leadership. Unlike general business operations, \nwhere roles and responsibilities are often established and consistent, projects often involve multiple \norganizations, departments, functions, or vendors that do not interact on a regular basis. Moreover, \nprojects may carry higher stakes and expectations than regular operational functions. As a result, \na broader array of managers, executives, senior contributors, and other stakeholders attempt to \ninfluence a project. This often creates higher degrees of confusion and con flict. Consequently, higher-\nperforming projects demonstrate effective leadership behaviors more frequently, and from more \npeople than most projects.\nA project environment that prioritizes vision, creativity, motiv ation, enthusiasm, encouragement, \nand empathy can support better o utcomes. These traits are ofte n associated with leadership. \nLeadership comprises the at titude , talent, character, and behav iors to influence individuals wit hin  \nand outside the project team toward the desired outcomes.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202141\nSection 3 – Project Management PrinciplesLeadership is not exclusive to any specific role. High-performing projects may feature \nmultiple people exhibiting effective leadership skills, for example, the project manager, sponsors, \nstakeholders, senior management, or even project team members. Anyone working on a project can demonstrate effective leadership traits, styles, and skills to help the project team perform and deliver the required results.\nIt is important to note that more conflict and confusion can emerge when too many participants \nattempt to exert project influence in multiple, misaligned directions. However, higher-performing projects show a paradoxical combination of more influencers, each contributing more leadership skills in a complementary fashion. For example: if a sponsor articulates clear priorities, then a technical lead opens the discussion for delivery options, where individual contributors assert pros and cons until the project manager brings the conversation to a consensus strategy. Successful leadership enables someone to influence, motivate, direct, and coach people under any condition. It also incorporates characteristics derived from an organization’s culture and practices.\nLeadership should not be confused with authority , which is the position of control given to \nindividuals within an organization to foster overall effective and efficient function. Authority is the right to exercise power. Authority is usually delegated to a person by formal means such as a charter document or designated title. This person may then have a role or position description that indicates their authority. Authority denotes accountability for certain activities, actions of individuals, or decision making in certain circumstances. While individuals may use their authority to influence, motivate, direct others, or act when others do not perform or act as directed or requested, this is not the same as leadership. For example, organizational executives may grant someone the authority to form  \na project team to deliver an outcome. However, authority alone is insufficient. It takes leadership to motivate a group toward a common goal, influence them to align their individual interests in favor  \nof collective effort, and achieve success as a project team rather than as individuals.\nEffective leadership draws from or combines elements of various styles of leadership. \nDocumented leadership styles range from autocratic, democratic, laissez-faire, directive, participative, assertive, supportive, and autocratic to consensus. Of all these, no single leadership style has proven to be the universally best or recommended approach. Instead, effective leadership is shown when  \nit best fits a given situation. For example:\n▶In moments of chaos, directive action creates more clarity and momentum than collaborative\nproblem solving.\n▶For environments with highly competent and engaged staff, empowered delegation elicits\nmore productivity than centralized coordination.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202142\nThe Standard for Project ManagementWhen senior managers suffer conflict over priorities, neutral facilitation helps more than detailed \nrecommendations. Effective leadership skill is grown. It can be learned and developed so that it \nbecomes a professional asset to the individual, as well as a benefit to the project and its stakeholders. High-performing projects show a pervasive pattern of continuous improvement down to the personal level. A project team member deepens leadership acumen by adding or practicing a combination of various skills or techniques, including but not limited to:\n▶Focusing a project team around agreed goals,\n▶Articulating a motivating vision for the project outcomes,\n▶Seeking resources and support for the project,\n▶Generating consensus on the best way forward,\n▶Overcoming obstacles to project progress,\n▶Negotiating and resolving conflict within the project team and between the project team\nand other stakeholders,\n▶Adapting communication style and messaging so that they are relevant to the audience,\n▶Coaching and mentoring fellow project team members,\n▶Appreciating and rewarding positive behaviors and contributions,\n▶Providing opportunities for skill growth and development,\n▶Facilitating collaborative decision making,\n▶Employing effective conversations and active listening,\n▶Empowering project team members and delegating responsibilities to them,\n▶Building a cohesive project team that takes responsibility,\n▶Showing empathy for project team and stakeholder perspectives,\n▶Having self-awareness of one’s own bias and behaviors,\n▶Managing and adapting to change during the project life cycle,\n▶Facilitating a fail-fast/learn quickly mindset by acknowledging mistakes, and\n▶Role modeling of desired behaviors.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202143\nSection 3 – Project Management PrinciplesPersonal character matters in a leader.

A person may have strong ability in leadership skills \nbut then have their influence undermined by the perception of being self-serving or untrustworthy. \nEffective leaders seek to be a role model in areas of honesty, integrity, and ethical conduct. Effective leaders focus on being transparent, behave unselfishly, and are able to ask for help. Effective leaders understand that project team members scrutinize and emulate the values, ethics, and behaviors that leaders exhibit. Therefore, leaders have an additional responsibility to demonstrate expected behaviors through their actions.\nProjects work best when leaders understand what motivates people. Project teams can thrive \nwhen project team members use appropriate leadership traits, skills, and characteristics that match the specific needs and expectations of stakeholders. Knowing how to best communicate with or motivate people, or take action when required, can help improve project team performance and manage obstacles to project success. When practiced by more than one person on a project, leadership can foster shared responsibility toward the project goal, which in turn can foster a healthy and vibrant environment. Motivators include such forces as finances, recognition, autonomy, compelling purpose, growth opportunity, and personal contribution.\nEffective leadership promotes project success and contributes to positive project outcomes. \nProject teams, individual project team members, and other stakeholders are engaged throughout  \na well-led project. Each project team member can focus on delivering results using a common vision and working toward shared outcomes. Effective leadership is essential in helping project teams maintain an ethical and adaptable environment.\nAdditionally, business obligations can be fulfilled based on delegated responsibility and authority. \nShared leadership does not undermine or diminish the role or authority of a leader designated by the organization, nor does it diminish the need for that leader to apply the right leadership style and skills at the right time.\nBy blending styles, continuing skill growth, and leveraging motivators, any project team member \nor stakeholder can motivate, influence, coach, and grow the project team, regardless of role or position.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202144\nThe Standard for Project Management3.7 TAILOR BASED ON CONTEXT\nAdapting to the unique objectives, stakeholders, and complexity of the environment contributes \nto project success. Tailoring is the deliberate adaptation of approach, governance, and processes to \nmake them more suitable for the given environment and the work at hand. Project teams tailor the appropriate framework that will enable the flexibility to consistently produce positive outcomes within the context of the life cycle of the project. The business environment, team size, degree of uncertainty, and complexity of the project all factor into how project systems are tailored. Project systems can be tailored with a holistic perspective, including the consideration of interrelated complexities. Tailoring aims to maximize value, manage constraints, and improve performance by using “just enough” processes, methods, templates, and artifacts to achieve the desired outcome from the project.TAILORING\nEach project is unique.\nProject success is based on adapting to the unique context of \nthe project to determ ine the most appropriate methods of  \nproducing the desired outcomes.\nTailoring the approach is iterativ e, and therefore is a continuous \nprocess throughout the project.Design the project devel-\nopment approach based on the context of the project,  its objectives,  \nstakeholders,  governance,  \nand the environment using “just enough” process to achieve the desired outcome while maximizing value,  managing cost, and \nenhancing speed.\nFigure 3-8. Tailor Based on Context\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202145\nSection 3 – Project Management PrinciplesTogether with the PMO and considering governance, project teams discuss and decide on the \ndelivery approach and resources required for producing outcomes on a project-by-project basis. This \nincludes the selection of the processes to use, development approach, methods, and artifacts needed to deliver the project outcomes. Tailoring decisions can be an implicit action of accepting an established methodology. Conversely, tailoring can be an explicit action of selecting and mixing specific elements  \nto suit the unique characteristics of the project and the project environment. Tailoring is necessary  \nto some degree in every project, because each project exists in a particular context.\nProjects are often unique, even when the deliverable of the project does not seem unique. \nThis is because project contexts differ in that the organization, its customers, its channels, and its environment are dynamic elements. Those changes and ongoing learning may cause project teams to use or develop different methods or approaches in pursuit of success. The project team should examine the unique set of conditions for each project, so that they can determine the most appropriate methods of producing the desired outcomes.\nAn existing methodology or common way of working can inform the way in which a project \nis tailored. A methodology is a system of practices, techniques, procedures, and rules used by those who work in a discipline. Project teams may be required to assume the methodology of the parent organization. That is, the project team adopts a system of processes, governance, methods, and templates that provide guidance on how to run the project.

Tailoring the approach along with appropriate processes, methods, and artifacts can help project teams make decisions about process-related costs and the related value contribution to project outcomes.\nIn addition to deciding on how to tailor an approach, project teams communicate the tailoring \ndecisions to stakeholders associated with that approach. Each member of the project team is aware of the chosen methods and processes that relate to those stakeholders and their role.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202146\nThe Standard for Project ManagementTailoring the project approach to suit the unique characteristics of the project and its \nenvironment can contribute to a higher level of project performance and an increased probability of \nsuccess. A tailored project approach can produce direct and indirect benefits to organizations, such as:\n▶Deeper commitment from project team members because they took part in defining\nthe approach,\n▶Reduction in waste in terms of actions or resources,\n▶Customer-oriented focus, as the needs of the customer and other stakeholders are\nan important influencing factor in the tailoring of the project, and\n▶More efficient use of project resources, as project teams are conscious of the weight\nof project processes.\nTailoring projects can lead to the following positive outcomes:\n▶Increased innovation, efficiency, and productivity;\n▶Lessons learned, so that improvements from a specific delivery approach can be shared\nand applied to the next round of work or future projects;\n▶Further improvement of an organization’s methodology, with new practices, methods,\nand artifacts;\n▶Discovery of improved outcomes, processes, or methods through experimentation;\n▶Effective integration within multidisciplinary project teams of methods and practices used\nto deliver project results; and\n▶Increased adaptability for the organization in the long term.\nTailoring an approach is iterative in nature, and therefore is a constant process itself during \nthe project life cycle. Project teams collect feedback from all stakeholders on how the methods and tailored processes are working for them as the project progresses to evaluate their effectiveness and add value to the organization.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202147\nSection 3 – Project Management Principles3.8 BUILD QUALITY INTO PROCESSES AND DELIVERABLES\nQuality is the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics of a product, service, or result \nfulfills the requirements. Quality includes the ability to satisfy the customer’s stated or implied needs. \nThe product, service, or result of a project (referred to here as deliverables) is measured for the quality of both the conformance to acceptance criteria and fitness for use.QUALITY\nProject quality entails satisfying stak eholders’  expectations and \nfulfilling project and product requirements.\nQuality focuses on meeting acceptance criteria for deli verables.\nProject quality entails ensuring project processes are appropri-\nate and as effective as possible.Maintain a focus on \nquality that produces deliverables that meet project objectives and align to the needs, uses,  \nand acceptance require-ments set forth by relevant stakeholders.\nFigure 3-9. Build Quality into Processes and Deliverables\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202148\nThe Standard for Project ManagementQuality may have several different dimensions, including but not limited to the following:\n▶Performance.  Does the deliverable function as the project team and other stakeholders\nintended?\n▶Conformity.  Is the deliverable fit for use, and does it meet the specifications?\n▶Reliability.  Does the deliverable produce consistent metrics each time it is performed\nor produced?\n▶Resilience.  Is the deliverable able to cope with unforeseen failures and quickly recover?\n▶Satisfaction.  Does the deliverable elicit positive feedback from end users? This includes\nusability and user experience?\n▶Uniformity.  Does the deliverable show parity with other deliverables produced in the\nsame manner?\n▶Efficiency. Does the deliverable produce the greatest output with the least amount\nof inputs and effort?\n▶Sustainability.  Does the deliverable produce a positive impact on economic, social,\nand environmental parameters?\nProject teams measure quality using metrics and acceptance criteria based on requirements. \nA requirement is a condition or capability that is necessary to be present in a product, service, or \nresult to satisfy a need. Requirements, either explicit or implicit, may come from stakeholders, a contract, organizational policies, standards, or regulatory bodies, or a combination of these. Quality is closely linked to the product acceptance criteria, as described in the statement of work or other design documents. These criteria should be updated as experimentation and prioritization occur and validated as part of the acceptance process.\nQuality is also relevant to the project approaches and activities used to produce the project’s \ndeliverables. While project teams evaluate the quality of a deliverable through inspection and testing, project activities and processes are assessed through reviews and audits. In both instances, quality activities may focus on detection and prevention of errors and defects.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202149\nSection 3 – Project Management PrinciplesThe objective of quality activities is to help ensure that what is delivered meets the objectives \nof the customer and other relevant stakeholders in the most straightforward path. The intention is \nto minimize the waste of resources and maximize the probability of attaining the desired outcome. This results in:\n▶Moving the deliverables to the point of delivery quickly, and\n▶Preventing defects in the deliverables or identifying them early to avoid or reduce the need\nfor rework and scrap.\nThe objective of quality activities is the same whether dealing with an up-front, well-defined set  \nof requirements or a set of requirements that are progressively elaborated and incrementally delivered.\nQuality management processes and practices help produce",

Navigate Complexity\nA project is a system of ele ments that interact with each other. Co mplexity is a characteristic o f \na project or its environment  that is difficult to manage due t o human behavior, system behavi or, and \nambiguity. The nature and number o f the  interactions determine the degree of complexity in a project. \nComplexity emerges from project ele ments, interactions between project elements, and interactions \nwith other systems and the pro ject environment. Though complexit y cannot be controlled, project \nteams can modify their activ ities to address impacts that occ ur as a result of complexity.\nProject teams often cannot foresee complexity emerging because it is the result of  \nmany interactions such as risks, dependencies, events, or relationships. Alternatively, a few  \ncauses may converge to produce a single complex effect, which makes isolating a specific cause \nof complexity difficult.\nProject complexity occurs as the result of individual elements within the project and project \nsystem as a whole. For example, complexity within a project may be ampli fied with a greater number \nor diversity of stakeholders, such as regulatory agencies, international financial institutions, multiple \nvendors, numerous specialty subcontractors, or local communities. These stakeholders can have a \nsignificant impact on the complexity of a project, both individually and collectively.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202151\nSection 3 – Project Management PrinciplesSome of the more common sources of complexity are:\n▶Human behavior. Human behavior is the interplay of conduct, demeanors, attitudes, and\nexperience of people. Human behavior can also contribute to complexity by introducingelements of subjectivity such as personal agendas that conflict with the project’s goals andobjectives. Stakeholders located in remote locations may have different time zones, speakdifferent languages, and have different cultural norms.\n▶System behavior.  System behavior is the result of dynamic interdependencies within\nand among project elements. For example, the integration of different technology systemsmay cause threats that could impact project outcomes and success. The interactionsamong components of the project system may lead to interconnected risk, create emergingor unforeseeable issues, and produce unclear and disproportional cause-and-effectrelationships.\n▶Uncertainty and ambiguity. Ambiguity is a state of being unclear, of not knowing what\nto expect or how to comprehend a situation. Ambiguity can arise from having many optionsor a lack of clarity on the optimal choice. Unclear or misleading events, emerging issues,\nor subjective situations can also lead to ambiguity.\nUncertainty  is the lack of understanding and awareness of issues, events, paths to follow, or\nsolutions to pursue. Uncertainty deals with the probabilities of alternative actions, reactions,and outcomes. Uncertainty includes unknown unknowns and black swans, which areemerging factors that are completely outside of existing knowledge or experience.\nWithin a complex environment, uncertainty and ambiguity can combine to blur causalrelationships to the point where probabilities and impacts are ill defined. It becomesdifficult to reduce uncertainty and ambiguity to the point where relationships can be welldefined and therefore addressed effectively.\n▶Technological innovation.  Technological innovation can cause disruption to products,\nservices, ways of working, processes, tools, techniques, procedures, and more. Theintroduction of desktop computing and social media are examples of technologicalinnovations that have fundamentally changed the way project work is performed. Newtechnology, along with the uncertainty of how that technology will be used, contributes\nto complexity. Innovation has the potential to help move projects toward a solution,\nor to disrupt the project when associated uncertainties are not defined, leading toincreased complexity.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202152\nThe Standard for Project ManagementComplexity may emerge and impact the project in any area and at any point in the project life \ncycle.

Project teams can identify elements of complexity throughout the project by continually looking \nat the project component as well as the project as a whole for signs of complexity. Knowledge of systems thinking, complex adaptive systems, experience from past project work, experimentation, and continuous learning related to system interaction leads to the project team’s increased ability to navigate complexity when it emerges. Being vigilant for indications of complexity allows project teams to adapt their approaches and plans to navigate potential disruption to effective project delivery.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202153\nSection 3 – Project Management Principles3.10 OPTIMIZE RISK RESPONSES\nA risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, can have a positive or negative effect \non one or more objectives. Identified risks may or may not materialize in a project. Project teams \nendeavor to identify and evaluate known and emergent risks, both internal and external to the project, throughout the life cycle.\nProject teams seek to maximize positive risks (opportunities) and decrease exposure to negative \nrisks (threats). Threats may result in issues such as delay, cost overrun, technical failure, performance shortfall, or loss of reputation. Opportunities can lead to benefits such as reduced time and cost, improved performance, increased market share, or enhanced reputation.RISK\nIndividual and overall risks can impact projects.\nRisks can be positive  (opport unities) or nega tive (threats).\nRisks are addressed continually throughout the project.An org anization’ s risk attitude, appetite, and threshold influence \nhow risk is addressed.\nRisk responses should be:\n•Appropriate for the significance of the risk ,\n•Cost effectiv e,\n•Realistic within the project context,\n•Agreed to by rele vant stak eholders,  and\n•Owned by a responsible person.Continually evaluate \nexposure to risk, both oppor tunities and threats,  \nto maximize positive impacts and minimize negative impacts to the project and its outcomes.\nFigure 3-11. Optimize Risk Responses\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202154\nThe Standard for Project ManagementProject teams also monitor the overall project risk. Overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty \non the project as a whole. Overall risk arises from all sources of uncertainty, including individual risks, \nand represents the exposure of the stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome, both positive and negative. Management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk exposure within an acceptable range. Management strategies include reducing drivers of threats, promoting drivers of opportunities, and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.\nProject team members engage with relevant stakeholders to understand their risk appetite \nand risk thresholds. Risk appetite describes the degree of uncertainty an organization or individual \nis willing to accept in anticipation of a reward. Risk threshold is the measure of acceptable variation \naround an objective that reflects the risk appetite of the organization and stakeholders. The risk threshold reflects the risk appetite. Therefore, a risk threshold of ±5% around a cost objective reflects a lower risk appetite than a risk threshold of ±10%. The risk appetite and risk threshold inform how the project team navigates risk in a project.\nEffective and appropriate risk responses can reduce individual and overall project threats and \nincrease individual and overall opportunities. Project teams should consistently identify potential risk responses with the following characteristics in mind:\n▶Appropriate and timely to the significance of the risk,\n▶Cost effective,\n▶Realistic within the project context,\n▶Agreed to by relevant stakeholders, and\n▶Owned by a responsible person.\nRisks can exist within the enterprise, portfolio, program, project, and product. The project \nmay be a component of a program in which the risk can potentially enhance or diminish benefits realization and, therefore, value. The project may be a component of a portfolio of related or unrelated work in which the risk can potentially enhance or diminish overall value of the portfolio and realization of business objectives.\nOrganizations and project teams that employ consistent risk evaluation, planning, and \nproactive risk implementation often find the effort to be less costly than reacting to issues when \nthe risk materializes.\nMore information on risk management may be found in The Standard for Risk Management \nin Portfolios, Programs, and Projects  [3].\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202155\nSection 3 – Project Management Principles3.11 EMBRACE ADAPTABILITY AND RESILIENCY\nMost projects encounter challenges or obstacles at some stage. The combined attributes of \nadaptability and resiliency in the project team’s approach to a project help the project accommodate \nimpacts and thrive. Adaptability  refers to the ability to respond to changing conditions. Resiliency \nconsists of two complementary traits: the ability to absorb impacts and the ability to recover quickly from a setback or failure. Both adaptability and resiliency are helpful characteristics for anyone working on projects.Build adaptability and \nresiliency into the organi-zation’ s and project team’ s \napproaches to help the project accommodate change,  recover from \nsetbacks,  and advance \nthe work of the project.ADAPTABILITY AND RESILIENCY\nAdaptability is the ability to respond to changing conditions.\nResiliency is the ability to absorb impacts and to reco ver \nquickly from a setback or failure.A focus on outcomes rather than outputs facilitates adaptability .  \nFigure 3-12.

Embrace Adaptability and Resiliency\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202156\nThe Standard for Project ManagementA project rarely performs exactly as initially planned. Projects are influenced by internal and \nexternal factors—new requirements, issues, stakeholder influences, among other factors—which \nexist in a system of interactions. Some elements within a project may fail or fall short of expectations, requiring the project team to regroup, rethink, and replan. On an infrastructure project, for example, a court decision during project execution could change the designs and plans. In a technology project, a computerized model of the technology might show that the components work together properly, but the real-world application fails. In both cases, the project team will need to address the situation in order to move the project forward. The view that projects should hold firm to plans and commitments made during the early stages, even after new or unforeseen factors emerge, is not beneficial to stakeholders, including customers and end users, as this limits the potential for generating value. However, adapting should be done with a holistic view, such as a proper change control process, to avoid problems such as scope creep. In a project environment, capabilities that support adaptability and resilience include:\n▶Short feedback loops to adapt quickly;\n▶Continuous learning and improvement;\n▶Project teams with broad skill sets, coupled with individuals having extensive knowledge\nin each required skill area;\n▶Regular inspection and adaptation of project work to identify improvement opportunities;\n▶Diverse project teams to capture a broad range of experiences;\n▶Open and transparent planning that engages internal and external stakeholders;\n▶Small-scale prototypes and experiments to test ideas and try new approaches;\n▶Ability to leverage new ways of thinking and working;\n▶Process design that balances velocity of work and stability of requirements;\n▶Open organizational conversations;\n▶Diverse project teams with broad skill sets, cultures, and experience, coupled with subject\nmatter experts in each required skill area;\n▶Understanding from past learning of the same or similar endeavors;\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202157\nSection 3 – Project Management Principles▶Ability and willingness to anticipate multiple potential scenarios and prepare for multiple\neventualities;\n▶Deferring decision making to the last responsible moment;\n▶Management support; and\n▶Open-ended design that balances speed and stability.\nEnvisioning outcomes rather than deliverables can enable solutions, harnessing a better \nresult than the one originally planned. For example, a project team may find an alternative solution \nthat would provide stronger outcomes than the original defined deliverable. While exploration of alternatives is usually the purview of the business case, technologies and other capabilities are evolving so rapidly that a solution could emerge at any time between completion of the business case and project closure. Opportunities for adaptation may emerge during a project, at which time the project team should make a case to the project sponsor, product owner, or customer for capturing the opportunity. Depending on the type of contract, the customer’s approval may be needed for some of the changes that result from the adaptation. The project team should be prepared to adapt its plans and activities to take advantage of the opportunity, with the support of the project sponsor, product owner, or customer.\nUnexpected changes and circumstances in a project system can also present opportunities. \nTo optimize value delivery, project teams should use problem solving as well as a holistic-thinking approach to changes and unplanned events. When an unplanned event occurs, project teams should look for potential positive outcomes that might be gained. For example, incorporating a change that occurs late in a project time line could add competitive advantage by being the first product in the market to offer the feature.\nBuilding adaptability and resiliency in a project keeps project teams focused on the desired \noutcome when internal and external factors change, and it helps them recover from setbacks. These characteristics also help project teams learn and improve so that they can quickly recover from failures or setbacks and continue making progress toward delivering value.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202158\nThe Standard for Project Management3.12  ENABLE CHANGE TO ACHIEVE THE ENVISIONED \nFUTURE ST\nATE\nRemaining relevant in today’s business environment is a fundamental challenge for all \norganizations. Relevance entails being responsive to stakeholder needs and desires. This requires \ncontinually evaluating offerings for the benefit of stakeholders, rapidly responding to changes, and acting as agents for change. Project managers are uniquely poised to keep an organization prepared for changes. Projects, by their very definition, create something new: they are agents of change.\nChange management, or enablement, is a comprehensive, cyclic, and structured approach for \ntransitioning individuals, groups, and organizations from a current state to a future state in which they realize desired benefits. It is different from project change control, which is a process whereby modifications to documents, deliverables, or baselines associated with the project are identified and documented, and then are approved or rejected.CHANGE\nA structured approach to change  helps individuals, groups, and \nthe organization transition from the curr ent state to a future \ndesired state.\nChang e can originate from intern al influences or exter nal \nsources.Enabling change  can be challenging as not all stak eholders \nembrace chang e.\nAttempting too much change  in a short  time can lead to \nchang e fatigue and/or resistance.\nStakeholder enga gement and motiva tional approaches assist in \nchang e adoption.Prepare those impacted \nfor the adoption and sustainment of new and different behaviors and \nprocesses required for the transition from the cur rent \nstate to the intended future state created by the project",

Enable Change to Achieve the Envisioned Future State\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202159\nSection 3 – Project Management PrinciplesChange in an organization can originate from internal sources, such as the need for a new \ncapability or in response to a performance gap. Change can also originate from external sources such \nas technological advances, demographic changes, or socioeconomic pressures. Any type of change involves some level of adaptability or assimilation by the group experiencing the change as well as the industries with which the group interacts.\nChange may be implemented by and have consequences for stakeholders. Enabling \nstakeholder change is part of facilitating the project to provide the required deliverable as well \nas the intended outcome.\nEnabling change in an organization can be challenging. Some people may seem inherently\n \nresistant to change or risk averse, and environments may display a conservative culture, among other reasons. Effective change management uses a motivational strategy rather than a forceful one. Engagement and two-way communication create an environment in which adoption and assimilation of change can occur or identify some valid concerns from the resistant users that  \nmay need to be addressed.\nProject team members and project managers can work with relevant stakeholders to address \nresistance, fatigue, and change absorption to increase the probability that change will be adopted or assimilated successfully by customers or recipients of project deliverables. This includes communicating the vision and goals associated with the change early in the project to achieve buy-in for the change. The benefits of the change and the impact on work processes should be communicated to all levels of the organization throughout the project.\nIt is also important to adapt the speed of change to the change appetite, cost, and ability of \nthe stakeholders and the environment to assimilate change. Attempting to create too many changes in too short a time can lead to resistance because of change saturation. Even when stakeholders unanimously agree that change will produce more value or enhance outcomes, they often still have difficulty working through the actions that will deliver enhanced benefits. To foster benefits realization, the project may also include activities to reinforce the change after its implementation in order  \nto avoid people returning to the initial state.\nRecognizing and addressing the needs of stakeholders to embrace change throughout the \nproject life cycle helps to integrate the resulting change in the project work, making a successful outcome more likely.\nMore information on organizational change management may be found in Managing Change \nin Organizations: A Practice Guide\n [4].\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202160\nThe Standard for Project ManagementREFERENCES\n[1] Project Management Institute. 2016.

As such, the information in the PMBOK\n® Guide may contain material \nthat has not been subjected to public review or a consensus process. In addition, it does not contain requirementconformance to an ANS standard.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021PMI Seventh Edition July 20213Introduction\nThis section describes important information about A Guide to the Project Management Body \nof Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – Seventh Edition. It describes the relationship of the PMBOK® Guide \nto The Standard for Project Management  [1],1 changes to the PMBOK® Guide, the relationship to \nPMIstandards+™ (PMI’s digital platform for standards), and provides a brief overview of the content.\n1.1 STRUCTURE OF THE PMBOK® GUIDE\nIn addition to this Introduction, this edition of the PMBOK® Guide contains three sections:\n▶Section 2 Project Performance Domains.  This section identifies and describes eight\nproject performance domains that form an integrated system to enable successful delivery\nof the project and intended outcomes.\n▶Section 3 Tailoring.  This section describes what tailoring is and presents an overview\nof what to tailor and how to go about tailoring individual projects.\n▶Section 4 Models, Methods, and Artifacts.  This section presents a brief description\nof commonly used models, methods, and artifacts. These models, methods, and artifactsillustrate the range of options project teams can use to produce deliverables, organizework, and enable communication and collaboration.1\n1 The numbers in brackets refer to the list of references at the end of the PMBOK® Guide.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 20214\nPMBOK® Guide1.2  RELATIONSHIP OF THE PMBOK® GUIDE AND \nTHE ST\nANDARD FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT\nWork in the project performance domains is guided by the principles of project management. \nAs described in The Standard for Project Management  [1], a principle is a fundamental norm, truth, \nor value. The principles for project management provide guidance for the behavior of people \ninvolved in projects as they influence and shape the performance domains to produce the intended outcomes. While there is conceptual overlap between the principles and the performance domains, the principles guide behavior, while the performance domains present broad areas of focus in which to demonstrate that behavior. Figure 1-1 shows how the project management principles sit above the performance domains, providing guidance to activities in each performance domain.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 20215\nSection 1 – IntroductionGuide BehaviorPrinciples of Project Management\nStakeholders\nProject WorkTeam\nDelivery PlanningUncert ainty\nMeasurementProject\nPerformance\nDomainsBe a dilig ent, respectful,\nand caring stewardFocus on v alue\nBuild quality into\nprocesses and delive rablesCreate a collaborativ e\nteam en vironment\nDemonstrate leadership\nbehaviors\nOptimize risk responses Navig ate complexityEffectiv ely eng age\nwith stak eholders\nTail",

Relationship between Project Management Principles and Project Performance Domains\nPMI Seventh Edition July 20216\nPMBOK® Guide1.3 CHANGES TO THE PMBOK® GUIDE\nThis edition of the PMBOK® Guide focuses on delivering outcomes regardless of the approach \nused by the project team. However, project practitioners using the PMBOK® Guide also benefit from \nsome level of understanding of how to deliver projects.\nThis edition is very different from the inputs, tools/techniques, and outputs (ITTOs) from \nprevious editions of the PMBOK® Guide. In the previous editions, the ITTOs supported implementation \nof various processes used in project management. The shift from a process-based standard to one \nbased on principles necessitates a different approach for thinking about the various aspects of \nproject management. Thus, the project performance domains represent a group of related activities \nthat are critical for the effective delivery of project outcomes. There are eight project performance \ndomains in this guide.\nTailoring is the deliberate adaptation of the project management approach, governance, \nand processes to make them more suitable for the given environment and the work at hand. The \ntailoring process is driven by the guiding project management principles, organizational values, and \norganizational culture.\nIn embracing the full spectrum of project approaches, this edition of the PMBOK® Guide \nrecognizes that no publication can capture every tool, technique, or practice that project teams \nmight use. Therefore, this edition presents an array of commonly used models, methods, and \nartifacts that project practitioners can use to accomplish their work.\n1.4 RELATIONSHIP TO PMIstandards+\nInformation in this guide is furt her elaborated on PMIstandards+, P MI’s digital content platform. \nThe digital platform encompas ses current and emerging pract ices and other useful informatio n \nrelated to PMI’s library of standards products. It also includes practical examples of applicat ion within \nvarious contexts and industry segments. PMIstandards+ evolved in response to advances and changes \nin how projects can be delivere d. It offers a dynamic body of knowle dge with real-time access and \nin-depth information that is ali gned to PMI standards and c arefully vetted by a panel of subject matter \nexperts representing a wide range of expertise.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 20217Project  \nPerformance Domains\nA project performance domain is a group of related activities that are critical for the effective \ndelivery of project outcomes. Project performance domains are interactive, interrelated, and \ninterdependent areas of focus that work in unison to achieve desired project outcomes. There are eight project performance domains:\n▶Stakeholders,\n▶Team,\n▶Development Approach and Life Cycle,\n▶Planning,\n▶Project Work,\n▶Delivery,\n▶Measurement, and\n▶Uncertainty.2\nTogether the performance domains form a unified whole. In this way, the performance domains \noperate as an integrated system, with each performance domain be ing interdependent of the other \nperformance domains to enable  succe ssful delivery of the project  and its intended outcomes.\nPerformance domains run concurrently throughout the project, regardless of how value is \ndelivered (frequently, periodically, or at the end of the project). For example, project leads spend \ntime focused on stakeholders, the project team, the project life cycle, the project work, and so forth, \nfrom the outset of the project to its closure. These areas of focus are not addressed as siloed e fforts \nbecause they overlap and interconnect. The ways in which the performance domains relate are \ndifferent for each project, but they are present in every project.\nThe specific activities undertake n within each of the performance do mains are determined \nby the context of the organizatio n, the project, deliverables, the  project team, stakeholders, and \nother factors. The performance domains are presented in the follo wing sections wit hout specific \nweighting or order.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 20218\nPMBOK® Guide2.1 STAKEHOLDER PERFORMANCE DOMAIN\nSTAKEHOLDER PERFORMANCE DOMAIN\nA productive working relationship with stak eholders \nthroughout the project.\nStakeholder agreement with project objectiv es.\nStakeholders who are project beneficiaries are suppor tive \nand satisfied wh ile stakeholders who may oppose the \nproject or its deliverables do not nega tively impact project \noutcomes.The Stakeholder \nPerformance Domain \naddresses activities and functions associated with stakeholder s.Effective  execution of this performance domain results in the \nfollowing desired outcomes:\nFigure 2-1.

This performance domain entails working \nwith stakeholders to maintain alignment and engaging with them to foster positive relationships  \nand satisfaction.\nStakeholders include individuals, groups, and organizations (see Figure 2-2). A project can \nhave a small group of stakeholders or potentially millions of stakeholders. There may be different \nstakeholders in different phases of the project, and the influence, power, or interests of stakeholders may change as the project unfolds.\n• Project Manage r\n• Project Manag ement\nTeam\n• Project Team• Governing Bodies\n• PMOs\n• Steering Committees• Suppliers\n• Customers\n• End Users\n• Regulatory  Bodies\nFigure 2-2. Examples of Project Stakeholders\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202110\nPMBOK® GuideEffective stakeholder identification, analysis, and engagement includes stakeholders who are \ninternal and external to the organization, those who are supportive of the project, and those who \nmay not be supportive or are neutral. While having relevant technical project management skills is an important aspect of successful projects, having the interpersonal and leadership skills to work effectively with stakeholders is just as important, if not more so.\n2.1.1  STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\nStakeholder engagement includes implementing strategies and actions to promote productive \ninvolvement of stakeholders. Stakeholder engagement activities start before or when the project starts and continue throughout the project.\nIdentify\nPrioritizeUnderstand Monitor\nAnalyze Engage\nFigure 2-3. Navigating Effective Stakeholder Engagement\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202111\nSection 2 – Project Performance DomainsDefining and sharing a clear vision at the start of the project can enable good relationships \nand alignment throughout the project. Establishing a clear vision that key stakeholders agree on can \nentail some challenging negotiations, especially with stakeholders who are not necessarily in favor of the project or its intended outcomes. As shown in Figure 2-3, there are several steps to engage stakeholders effectively.\n2.1.1.1  Identify\nHigh-level stakeholder identification may be carried out prior to forming the project team. \nDetailed stakeholder identification progressively elaborates the initial work and is a continuous activity throughout the project. Some stakeholders are easy to identify, such as the customer, sponsor, project team, end users, and so forth, but others can be difficult to identify when they are not directly connected to the project.\n2.1.1.2  Understand and Analyze\nOnce stakeholders are identified, the project manager and the project team should seek \nto understand stakeholders’ feelings, emotions, beliefs, and values. These elements can lead to additional threats or opportunities for the project outcomes. They can also change quickly, and as such, understanding and analyzing stakeholders is an ongoing action.\nRelated to understanding the project stakeholders is the need to analyze aspects of each \nstakeholder’s position on and perspective of the project. Analyzing stakeholders considers several stakeholder aspects, such as:\n▶Power,\n▶Impact,\n▶Attitude,\n▶Beliefs,\n▶Expectations,\n▶Degree of influence,\n▶Proximity to the project,\n▶Interest in the project, and\n▶Other aspects surrounding stakeholder interaction with the project.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202112\nPMBOK® GuideThis information helps the project team consider interactions that may in fluence the \nmotivations, actions, and behaviors of stakeholders. In addition to individual analysis, the project \nteam should consider how stakeholders interact with each other, as they often form alliances that \nhelp or hinder the project’s objectives. For example, if the project team believes a key business \nmanager is highly influential but has negative perceptions related to the project, they can explore \nhow to detect the business manager’s perceptions and respond appropriately as the project unfolds. \nIn all cases, the analysis work should be held in confidence by the project team since the information \ncould be misinterpreted outside the context for the analysis.\n2.1.1.3 Prioritize\nOn many projects, there are t oo many stakeholders involved for t he project team to engage \ndirectly or effectively with all of them. Based on its anal ysis, t he project team can complete  an initial \nprioritization of stakeholders. It is common to focus on stakeholders  with the most power and interest  \nas one way to prioritize engageme nt. As events unfold throughout t he project, the project team may \nneed to reprioritize based on new stakeholders or evolving changes in the stakeholder landscape.\n2.1.1.4 Engage\nStakeholder engagement entails working collaboratively with stakeholders to introduce the \nproject, elicit their requirements, manage expectations, resolve issues, negotiate, prioritize, problem \nsolve, and make decisions. Engaging stakeholders requires the application of soft skills, such as \nactive listening, interpersonal skills, and conflict management, as well as leadership skills such as \nestablishing the vision and critical thinking.\nCommunication with stakeholders can take place via written or verbal means, and it can be \nformal or informal. Examples of each type of communication are shown in Table 2-1.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202113\nSection 2 – Project Performance DomainsCommunication methods include push, pull, and interactive communication:\n▶Push. Communication sent to stakeholders such as memos, emails, status reports,\nvoice mail, and so forth. Push communication is used for one-way communications withindividual",

Communication sent to stakeholders such as memos, emails, status reports,\nvoice mail, and so forth. Push communication is used for one-way communications withindividual stakeholders or groups of stakeholders. Push communication inhibits the abilityto immediately gauge reaction and assess understanding; therefore, it should be useddeliberately.\n▶Pull. Information sought by the stakeholder, such as a project team member going to anintranet to find communication policies or templates, running internet searches, and usingonline repositories. Pulling information is used for indirect sensing of stakeholder concerns.\nEngagement goes deeper than pushing or pulling communication. Engagement is interactive. \nIt includes an exchange of information with one or more stakeholders such as conversations, phone calls, meetings, brainstorming, product demos, and the like.\nWith all forms of communication, quick feedback loops provide useful information to:\n▶Confirm the degree to which the stakeholder(s) heard the message.\n▶Determine if stakeholders agree with the message.\n▶Identify nuanced or other unintended messages the recipient detected.\n▶Gain other helpful insights.Table 2-1.

As the project progresses, the attitude or power of some stakeholders may \nchange. In addition to identifying and analyzing new stakeholders, there is an opportunity to assess \nwhether the current engagement strategy is effective or if it needs to be adjusted. Therefore, the \namount and effectiveness of stakeholder engagement is monitored throughout the project.\nThe degree of stakeholder satisfaction can often be determined by having a conversation with \nstakeholders to gauge their satisfaction with the project deliverables and the overall management of \nthe project. Project and iteration reviews, product reviews, stage gates, and other methods are ways \nto obtain periodic feedback. For large groups of stakeholders, a survey can be used to assess the \ndegree of satisfaction. Where necessary, the stakeholder engagement approach can be updated to \nachieve higher stakeholder satisfaction.\n2.1.2  INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMA NCE DOMAINS\nStakeholders permeate all aspects of the project. They define and prioritize the requirements \nand scope for the project team. They participate in and shape the planning. They determine \nacceptance and quality criteria for the project deliverables and outcomes. Much of the project work \nis around engaging and communicating with stakeholders. Throughout the project or at its closure, \nthey use the project deliverables and influence the realization of project outcomes.\nSome stakeholders can assist in lowering the amount of uncertainty present on a project while \nothers may cause an increase in uncertainty. Stakeholders such as customers, senior management, \nproject management office leads, or program managers will focus on measures of performance for \nthe project and its deliverables.

A set of individuals performing the work of the project to achieve its objectives. \nPMI Seventh Edition July 202117\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.2.1  PROJECT TEAM MANAGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP\nProject management entails applying knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques for management \nactivities as well as leadership activities. Management activities focus on the means of meeting \nproject objectives, such as having effective processes, planning, coordinating, measuring, and monitoring work, among others. Leadership activities focus on people. Leadership includes influencing, motivating, listening, enabling, and other activities having to do with the project team. Both are important in delivering the intended outcomes.\n2.2.1.1  Centralized Management and Leadership\nWhile leadership activities should be practiced by all project team members, management \nactivities may be centralized or distributed. In an environment where management activities are centralized, accountability (being answerable for an outcome), is usually assigned to one individual, such as the project manager or similar role. In these situations, a project charter or other authorizing document can provide approval for the project manager to form a project team to achieve the project outcomes.\n2.2.1.2  Distributed Management and Leadership\nSometimes project management activities are shared among a project management team, \nand project team members are responsible for completing the work. There are also situations where a project team may self-organize to complete a project. Rather than having a designated project manager, someone within the project team may serve as facilitator to enable communication, collaboration, and engagement. This role may shift among project team members.\nServant leadership is a style of leadership that focuses on understanding and addressing the \nneeds and development of project team members in order to enable the highest possible project team performance. Servant leaders place emphasis on developing project team members to their highest potential by focusing on addressing questions, such as:\n▶Are project team members growing as individuals?\n▶Are project team members becoming healthier, wiser, freer, and more autonomous?\n▶Are project team members more likely to become servant leaders?\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202118\nPMBOK® GuideServant leaders allow project teams to self-organize when possible and increase levels of \nautonomy by passing appropriate decision-making opportunities to project team members. Servant \nleadership behaviors include:\n▶Obstacle removal.  Since it is the project team who generates the majority of business\nvalue, a critical role for the servant leader is to maximize delivery by removing impedimentsto their progress. This includes solving problems and removing obstacles that may behampering the project team’s work. By solving or easing these impediments, the projectteam can deliver value to the business faster.\n▶Diversion shield.  Servant leaders protect the project team from internal and external\ndiversions that redirect the project team from the current objectives. Time fragmentationreduces productivity, so shielding the project team from noncritical, external demandshelps the project team stay focused.\n▶Encouragement and development opportunities.  The servant leader also provides\ntools and encouragement to keep the project team satisfied and productive. Learning whatmotivates project team members as individuals and finding ways to reward them for goodwork helps keep project team members satisfied.\n2.2.1.3  Common Aspects of Team Development\nRegardless of how the management activities are structured, there are common aspects \nof project team development that are relevant for most project teams. These include: \n▶Vision and objectives.  It is essential that everyone is aware of the project vision and\nobjectives. The vision and objectives are communicated throughout the project. Thisincludes referencing the intended outcomes when the project team is engaged in makingdecisions and solving problems.\n▶Roles and responsibilities.  It is important to make sure project team members\nunderstand and fulfill their roles and responsibilities. This can include identifying gapsin knowledge and skills as well as strategies to address those gaps through training,mentoring, or coaching.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202119\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains▶Project team operations.  Facilitating project team communication, problem solving, and\nthe process of coming to consensus may include working with the project team to develop\na project team charter and a set of operating guidelines or project team norms.\n▶Guidance.  Guidance can be directed to the overall project team to keep everyone headed\nin the right direction. Individual project team members may also provide guidance on\na particular task or deliverable.\n▶Growth.  Identifying areas where the project team is performing well and pointing out areas\nwhere the project team can improve helps the project team to grow. Working collaboratively,the project team can identify goals for its improvement and take steps to meet those goals.This also applies to each individual on the project team. Individuals may want to grow theirskills and experience in certain areas, and the project manager can assist with that.\nThere are several models that describe the stages of project team growth included in Section 4.\nWhen project teams form across different organizations based on a contract, strategic \npartnership, or other business relationship, specific roles that perform various functions may be more formalized and less flexible depending on the contract or other terms. Such arrangements often require more up-front work to establish a “one team” mindset, ensure project team members understand how everyone contributes to the project, and establish other enablers that integrate skills, capabilities, and processes.\nPMI",

The project team’s culture may be established \ndeliberately by developing project team norms, or informally through the behaviors and actions of its \nproject team members. The project team culture operates within the organization’s culture but reflects the project team’s individual ways of working and interacting.\nThe project manager is key in establishing and maintaining a safe, respectful, nonjudgmental \nenvironment that allows the project team to communicate openly. One way to accomplish this is by modeling desired behaviors, such as:\n▶Transparency.  Being transparent in how one thinks, makes choices, and processes\ninformation helps others identify and share their own processes. This can extend to beingtransparent about biases as well.\n▶Integrity. Integrity is comprised of ethical behavior and honesty. Individualsdemonstrate honesty by surfacing risks, communicating their assumptions and basisof estimates, delivering bad news early, ensuring status reports provide an accuratedepiction of the project’s status, and in many other ways. Ethical behavior can includesurfacing potential defects or negative effects in product design, disclosing potentialconflicts of interest, ensuring fairness, and making decisions based on environmental,stakeholder, and financial impacts.\nHuman beings have a set of biases, some of them unconscious and some of them conscious.  \nFor example, one person may feel that unless a schedule is displayed using a software-generated Gantt chart, that it is not a true or valid schedule. Another person may have a contrasting bias that detailed planning any further out than 30 days is a waste of time. Being open and transparent about biases up front establishes a culture of openness and trust that can enable consensus and collaboration. \nPMI Seventh Edition July 202121\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains▶Respect. Demonstrating respect for each person, how the person thinks, the person’s\nskills, and the perspective and expertise the person brings to the project team sets thestage for all project team members to adopt this behavior.\n▶Positive discourse.  Throughout the project, diverse opinions, different ways of\napproaching situations, and misunderstandings will occur. These are a normal part ofconducting projects. They present an opportunity to have a dialogue rather than a debate.A dialogue entails working with others to resolve divergent opinions. The goal is to arriveat a resolution that all parties can embrace. A debate, on the other hand, is a win-losescenario where people are more interested in winning personally than they are in beingopen to alternative solutions to a problem.\n▶Support.  Projects can be challenging from the perspectives of technical challenges,\nenvironmental influences, and interpersonal interactions. Supporting project teammembers through problem solving and removing impediments builds a supportive cultureand leads to a trusting and collaborative environment. Support can also be demonstratedby providing encouragement, showing empathy, and engaging in active listening.\n▶Courage. Recommending a new approach to a problem or a way of working can beintimidating. Likewise, it can be challenging to disagree with a subject matter expert orsomeone with greater authority. However, demonstrating the courage that it takes to makea suggestion, disagree, or try something new enables a culture of experimentation andcommunicates to others that it is safe to be courageous and try new approaches.\n▶Celebrating success.  Focusing on project goals, challenges, and issues often sidelines\nthe fact that individual project team members and the project team as a whole are steadilyprogressing toward those goals. Because work takes priority, project team members maydefer recognizing demonstrations of innovation, adaptation, service to others, and learning.However, recognizing such contributions in real time can keep the project team andindividuals motivated.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202122\nPMBOK® Guide2.2.3  HIGH-PERFORMING PROJECT TEAMS\nOne goal of effective leadership is to create a high-performing project team. There are a number \nof factors that contribute to high-performing project teams. The list below is not comprehensive, but  \nit identifies some of the factors associated with high-performing project teams.\n▶Open communication.  An environment that fosters open and safe communication\nallows for productive meetings, problem solving, brainstorming, and so forth. It is also the\ncornerstone for other factors, such as shared understanding, trust, and collaboration.\n▶Shared understanding.  The purpose for the project and the benefits it will provide are\nheld in common.\n▶Shared ownership.  The more ownership of the outcomes that project team members\nfeel, the better they are likely to perform.\n▶Trust. A project team in which its members trust each other is willing to go the extra distanceto deliver success. People are less likely to do the extra work it may take to succeed if they\ndo not trust their project team members, project manager, or the organization.\n▶Collaboration.  Project teams that collaborate and work with each other rather than work\nin silos or compete tend to generate more diverse ideas and end up with better outcomes.\n▶Adaptability.  Project teams that are able to adapt the way they work to the environment\nand the situation are more effective.\n▶Resilience.  When issues or failures occur, high-performing project teams recover quickly.\n▶Empowerment.  Project team members who feel empowered to make decisions about the\nway they",

Project teams who are recognized for the work they put in and the\nperformance they achieve are more likely to continue to perform well. Even the simple\nact of showing appreciation reinforces positive team behavior.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202123\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.2.4  LEADERSHIP SKILLS\nLeadership skills are useful for all project team members whether the project team is operating \nin an environment with a centralized authority or a shared leadership environment. The following \nsections describe some of the traits and activities associated with leadership.\n2.2.4.1  Establishing and Maintaining Vision\nEvery project has a purpose. Understanding that purpose is critical for people to commit \ntheir time and energy in the right direction toward achieving the project purpose. The project vision summarizes the project’s purpose clearly and succinctly. It describes a realistic, attractive view of the future project outcomes.\nIn addition to briefly describing the desired future state, the vision is a powerful motivational \ntool. It is a way to create passion and meaning for a project’s envisioned goal. A common vision helps keep people pulling in the same direction. When immersed in the details of everyday work, a clear understanding of the end goal can help guide local decisions toward the desired project outcome.\nA vision developed collaboratively between project team members and key stakeholders should \nanswer these questions:\n▶What is the project purpose?\n▶What defines successful project work?\n▶How will the future be better when the project outcomes are delivered?\n▶How will the project team know that it is drifting from the vision?\nA good vision is clear, concise, and actionable. It does the following:\n▶Summarizes the project with a powerful phrase or short description,\n▶Describes the best achievable outcome,\n▶Creates a common, cohesive picture in project team members’ minds, and\n▶Inspires passion for the outcome.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202124\nPMBOK® Guide2.2.4.2  Critical Thinking\nThroughout the various project performance domains, there is a need to recognize bias, \nidentify the root cause of problems, and consider challenging issues, such as ambiguity, complexity, \nand so forth. Critical thinking helps to accomplish these activities. Critical thinking includes disciplined, rational, logical, evidence-based thinking. It requires an open mind and the ability to analyze objectively. Critical thinking, especially when applied to discovery, can include conceptual imagination, insight, and intuition. It can also include reflective thinking and metacognition (thinking about thinking and being aware of one’s awareness).\nProject team members apply critical thinking to:\n▶Research and gather unbiased, well-balanced information;\n▶Recognize, analyze, and resolve problems;\n▶Identify bias, unstated assumptions, and values;\n▶Discern the use of language and the influence on oneself and others;\n▶Analyze data and evidence to evaluate arguments and perspectives;\n▶Observe events to identify patterns and relationships;\n▶Apply inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning appropriately; and\n▶Identify and articulate false premises, false analogy, emotional appeals, and other faulty logic.\n2.2.4.3  Motivation\nMotivating project team members has two aspects: the first is understanding what motivates \nproject team members to perform, and the second is working with project team members in such  \na way that they remain committed to the project and its outcomes.\nMotivation to perform can be intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation comes from inside the \nindividual or is associated with the work. It is associated with finding pleasure in the work itself rather than focusing on rewards. Extrinsic motivation is performing work because of an external reward such as a bonus. Much of the work done on projects is aligned with intrinsic motivation.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202125\nSection 2 – Project Performance DomainsExamples of intrinsic motivation factors include:\n▶Achievement,\n▶Challenge,\n▶Belief in the work,\n▶Making a difference,\n▶Self-direction and autonomy,\n▶Responsibility,\n▶Personal growth,\n▶Relatedness, and\n▶Being part of a project team.\nPeople are not motivated by just one thing; however, most people have a dominant motivator. \nTo effectively motivate project team members, it is helpful to know each member’s dominant \nmotivator. For example, a project team member who is motivated by challenge will respond well to stretch goals and problems to solve. A project team member who is motivated by relatedness will respond to being part of a dynamic working group. Project team members who thrive on autonomy will perform better if they can establish their own ways of working and even their own work hours and cadence. Therefore, tailoring motivation methods based on individual preferences helps to elicit the best individual and project team performance.\n2.2.4.4  Interpersonal Skills\nInterpersonal skills that are used frequently in projects include emotional intelligence, decision \nmaking, and conflict resolution among others.\n▶Emotional intelligence.  Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize our own emotions\nand those of others. This information is used to guide thinking and behavior. Recognition ofpersonal feelings, empathy for the feelings of others, and the ability to act appropriately arethe cornerstones for effective communication, collaboration, and leadership.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202126\nPMBOK® GuideSince projects are undertaken by people and for people, emotional intelligence—the ability \nto",

This information is used to guide thinking and behavior. Recognition ofpersonal feelings, empathy for the feelings of others, and the ability to act appropriately arethe cornerstones for effective communication, collaboration, and leadership.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202126\nPMBOK® GuideSince projects are undertaken by people and for people, emotional intelligence—the ability \nto understand one’s self and effectively sustain working relationships with others—is critical \nin project team environments.\nThere are multiple models for defining and explaining emotional intelligence. They converge \non four key areas:\n▹Self-awareness.  Self-awareness is the ability to conduct a realistic self-assessment.\nIt includes understanding our own emotions, goals, motivations, strengths, andweaknesses.\n▹Self-management.  Self-management, also known as self-regulation, is the ability to\ncontrol and redirect disruptive feelings and impulses. It is the ability to think beforeacting, suspending snap judgments and impulsive decisions.\n▹Social awareness. Social awareness is about empathy and understanding andconsidering other people’s feelings. This includes the ability to read nonverbal cuesand body language.\n▹Social skill.  Social skill is the culmination of the other dimensions of emotional\nintelligence. It is concerned with managing groups of people, such as project teams,building social networks, finding common ground with various stakeholders, andbuilding rapport.\nSelf-awareness and self-management are required to remain calm and productive during \ndifficult project circumstances. Social awareness and social skills allow for better bonds with project team members and project stakeholders. Emotional intelligence is a basis of all forms of leadership.\nFigure 2-5 shows the key points for each of the four aspects of emotional intelligence and how \nthey relate. The aspects having to do with oneself are on the top, and the social aspects are on the bottom. Awareness is on the left side, and management and skill are on the right side.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202127\nSection 2 – Project Performance DomainsSome models for emotional intelligence include a fifth area for motivation. Motivation in this \ncontext is about understanding what drives and inspires people.\n▶Decision making.  Project managers and project teams make many decisions daily. Some\ndecisions may be fairly inconsequential to the project outcome, such as where to go for a\nteam lunch, and others will be very impactful, such as what development approach to use,which tool to use, or what vendor to select.Social Awareness\n•Be empathetic\n•Employ active\nlisteningSocial Skill\n•Establish rapport\n•Build effectiveteams\n•Manage attitudeSelf-Management\n•Think before you act\n•Build trustSelf-Awareness\n•How do you affectthe team?\n•How does the teamaffect you?\nFigure 2-5. Components of Emotional Intelligence\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202128\nPMBOK® GuideDecisions can be made unilaterally. This has the advantage of being fast but is prone \nto error when compared to engaging the wisdom of a diverse set of people. Unilateral \ndecision making can also demotivate people who are impacted by the decision since they may feel their views and concerns were not considered.\nGroup-based decision making has the benefit of tapping into the broad knowledge base \nof a group. Engaging people in the decision-making process also increases buy-in to the outcome, even if the option selected may not have been everyone’s first choice. Generally, inclusion increases commitment to the decision. The downside of group decision making is the time required and interruption to teamwork that can occur when taking people away from their work to be consulted in a decision.\nProject team decision making often follows a diverge/converge pattern. This means \nstakeholders are first engaged to generate a broad set of solution alternatives or approaches. This is often done individually to avoid the effect of senior or charismatic stakeholders unduly influencing other stakeholders. Then, after a broad spectrum of decision alternatives have been generated, the project team converges on a preferred solution.\nThe goal is to make decisions quickly while engaging the diverse knowledge of a group in  \nan inclusive and respectful manner. Some decisions may be made in a different direction than some people prefer, but everyone has an opportunity to explain their position. In the end, the deciding authority, whether an individual or a group, makes a decision based on the presented analysis and with consideration for stakeholder expectations.\nCareful selection of which decisions should go for group discussion and voting limits the \ninterruptions and task switching experienced by the project team. Many approaches such as Roman voting, wideband Delphi estimating, and fist of five voting use the diverge/converge pattern. They aim to engage individual input while voting at the same moment, which minimizes groupthink.\nFor those decisions that are beyond the authority of the project team to decide, the project \nteam can investigate alternatives, consider impacts of each alternative, and escalate the decision to someone with the proper authority. This process aligns with the philosophy of “don’t bring me problems, bring me solutions,” while remaining aligned with organizational governance regarding decision-making authority.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202129\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains▶Conflict management. Conflict happens on all projects. Projects operate in dynamic\nenvironments and face many mutually exclusive constraints including budget, scope,schedule, and quality, which can lead to conflicts. It is not uncommon to want to avoidconflict, but not all conflict is negative. How conflict is handled can either lead to moreconflict or to better decision making and stronger solutions.\nAddressing conflict before it escalates beyond useful debate leads to better outcomes.\nThe following approaches can help:\n▹Keep communications open and respectful.

Because conflict can cause anxiety, it is\nimportant to keep a safe environment to explore the source of the conflict. Without asafe environment, people will stop communicating. Make sure words, tone of voice,\nand body language remain nonthreatening.\n▹Focus on the issues, not the people.  Conflict is based on people perceiving situations\ndifferently. It should not be personal. The focus is on resolving the situation,\nnot casting blame.\n▹Focus on the present and future, not the past.  Stay focused on the current situation,\nnot past situations. If something similar happened previously, bringing up the past willnot resolve the current situation. In fact, it can serve to intensify the current situationeven more.\n▹Search for alternatives together.  Damage incurred from conflict can be repaired by\nlooking for resolutions and alternatives together. It can also create more constructiverelationships. This moves the conflict into more of a problem-solving space wherepeople can work together to generate creative alternatives.\nThere are several models for addressing and resolving conflict. Some of them are discussed \nin Section 4.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202130\nPMBOK® Guide2.2.5  TAILORING LEADERSHIP STYLES\nAs with all aspects of projects, leadership styles are also tailored to meet the needs of the \nproject, the environment, and the stakeholders. Some of the variables that influence tailoring of \nleadership styles include:\n▶Experience with the type of project.  Organizations and project teams with experience\non a specific type of project may be more self-managing and require less leadership. Whena project is new to an organization, the tendency is to provide more oversight and to use\na more directive leadership style.\n▶Maturity of the project team members.  Project team members who are mature in the\ntechnical field may need less oversight and direction than project team members who arenew to the organization, the team, or the technical specialty.\n▶Organizational governance structures.  Projects operate within a larger organizational\nsystem. There may be the expectation that the organizational leadership style of topmanagement is recognized and reflected in the team’s leadership. The organizationalstructure influences the degree to which authority and accountability are centralized\nor distributed.\n▶Distributed project teams.  A global project workforce is more common today than in the\npast. In spite of the best efforts to connect people virtually, it can be challenging to createthe same level of collaboration and relatedness that is achieved when working face to face.To minimize the pitfalls of distributed project teams, technology can be used to increaseand improve communication. Examples include:\n▹Ensure there are collaboration sites for working together.\n▹Have a project team site to keep all relevant project and project team\ninformation available.\n▹Use audio and video capabilities for meetings.\n▹Use technology to maintain ongoing contact, such as messaging and texting.\n▹Build in time to get to know remote project team members.\n▹Have at least one face-to-face meeting to establish relationships.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202131\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.2.6  INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nThe Team Performance Domain emphasizes the skills used by project managers and project \nteam members throughout the project. These skills are woven into all other aspects of the project. \nProject team members are called on to demonstrate leadership qualities and skills throughout the project. Communicating the project vision and benefits to stakeholders while planning and throughout the life cycle is one example. Another example is employing critical thinking, problem solving, and decision making while engaging in project work. Accountability for outcomes is demonstrated throughout the Planning and Measurement Performance Domains.\n2.2.7  CHECKING RESULTS\nTable 2-3 identifies the outcomes from effective application of the Team Performance Domain \non the left and ways of checking them on the right.\nTable 2-3.

A method used to create and evolve the product, service, or result during \nthe project life cycle, such as a predictive, iterative, incremental, adaptive, or hybrid method.\nCadence. A rhythm of activities conducted throughout the project.Project Phase. A collection of logically related project activities that culminates in the completion \nof one or more deliverables.\nProject Life Cycle. The series of phases that a project passes through from its start to \nits completion.\n \nPMI Seventh Edition July 202134\nPMBOK® Guide▶Single delivery.  Projects that have a single delivery deliver at the end of the project. For\nexample, a process reengineering project may not have any deliveries until near the end of\nthe project when the new process is rolled out.\n▶Multiple deliveries.  Some projects have multiple deliveries. A project may have multiple\ncomponents that are delivered at different times throughout the project. A project todevelop a new drug may have multiple deliveries, such as preclinical submissions, Phase 1trial results, Phase 2 trial results, Phase 3 trial results, registration, and then launch. In thisexample, the deliveries are sequential. Some projects have deliveries that are developedseparately rather than sequentially, such as a project to update building security. Deliveriesmay include physical barriers to entry, new badges, new key code pads, and so forth. Eachof these is a separate delivery, but they do not need to come in a specific order. All of thedeliveries are concluded before the project is considered to be completed.\n▶Periodic deliveries.  Periodic deliveries are like multiple deliveries, but they are on a\nfixed delivery schedule, such as monthly or bimonthly. A new software application mayhave internal deliveries every two weeks, and then periodically release the deliveries\ninto the market.\nAnother delivery option is called continuous delivery. Continuous delivery is the practice of \ndelivering feature increments immediately to customers, often through the use of small batches of work and automation technology. Continuous delivery can be used for digital products. From the product management perspective, the emphasis is on delivering benefits and value throughout the product life cycle. Similar to a project, there are aspects that are development oriented. However, similar to a program, there can be many development cycles as well as maintenance activities. This type of undertaking works better with project teams that are stable and remain intact. Because the project teams are focused on one product, they can apply learning about the product, the stakeholders, and the market. This allows the team to respond to market trends and stay focused on value delivery. This practice is included in several approaches such as DevOps, #noprojects and Continuous Digital, for example. \nPMI Seventh Edition July 202135\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.3.3  DEVELOPMENT APPROACHES\nA development approach is the means used to create and evolve the product, service, or result \nduring the project life cycle. There are different development approaches, and different industries \nmay use different terms to refer to development approaches. Three commonly used approaches are predictive, hybrid, and adaptive. As shown in Figure 2-7, these approaches are often viewed as a spectrum, from the predictive approach on one end of the spectrum, to the adaptive on the other end.\n▶Predictive approach.  A predictive approach is useful when the project and product\nrequirements can be defined, collected, and analyzed at the start of the project. This mayalso be referred to as a waterfall approach. This approach may also be used when thereis a significant investment involved and a high level of risk that may require frequentreviews, change control mechanisms, and replanning between development phases. Thescope, schedule, cost, resource needs, and risks can be well defined in the early phasesof the project life cycle, and they are relatively stable. This development approach allowsthe project team to reduce the level of uncertainty early in the project and do much ofthe planning up front. Predictive approaches may use proof-of-concept developments toexplore options, but the majority of the project work follows the plans that were developednear the start of the project. Many times, projects that use this approach have templatesfrom previous, similar projects.Development Approaches\nPredictive Hybrid Adaptive \nIncreasingly Iterative and Incremental\nFigure 2-7.

Development Approaches\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202136\nPMBOK® Guide▶Hybrid approach.  A hybrid development approach is a combination of adaptive and\npredictive approaches. This means that some elements from a predictive approach are\nused and some from an adaptive approach are used. This development approach is usefulwhen there is uncertainty or risk around the requirements. Hybrid is also useful whendeliverables can be modularized, or when there are deliverables that can be developed\nby different project teams. A hybrid approach is more adaptive than a predictive approach,but less so than a purely adaptive approach.\nHybrid approaches often use an iterative or incremental development approach. An\niterative approach is useful for clarifying requirements and investigating various options.\nAn iterative approach may produce sufficient capability to be considered acceptable priorto the final iteration. An incremental approach is used to produce a deliverable throughouta series of iterations. Each iteration adds functionality within a predetermined time frame\n(a timebox). The deliverable contains the capability to be considered as completed onlyafter the final iteration.\nThe differences and interactions between iterative and incremental development are\nshown in Figure 2-8.\nAn example of a hybrid approach could be using an adaptive approach to develop a\nproduct that has significant uncertainty associated with the requirements. However, thedeployment of the product can be done using a predictive approach. Another example isa project with two main deliverables where one deliverable is developed using an adaptiveapproach and the other using a predictive approach.\nA project to develop a new community center might use a predictive approach for the \nconstruction of the grounds and facilities. The scope, schedule, cost, and resources would be determined up front, and changes would likely be minimal. The construction process would follow the plans and blueprints. \nPMI Seventh Edition July 202137\nSection 2 – Project Performance DomainsIterative\nTry different\nideas to\nclarify scope,approach,  and\nrequirements\nIncremental\nProgressivelydevel op features\nand functionsFeedback and adapt Feedback and adapt Feedback and adaptVoice\nTranscription\nFeedback and adapt Feedback and adapt Feedback and adapt\nCustomer :\nIneed a \nmethod to capture ideas that mightchange.\nFigure 2-8. Iterative and Incremental Development\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202138\nPMBOK® Guide▶Adaptive approach.  Adaptive approaches are useful when requirements are subject to\na high level of uncertainty and volatility and are likely to change throughout the project. A\nclear vision is established at the start of the project, and the initial known requirements arerefined, detailed, changed, or replaced in accordance with user feedback, the environment,or unexpected events.\nAdaptive approaches use iterative and incremental approaches. However, on the far side\nof the adaptive methods, the iterations tend to get shorter and the product is more likelyto evolve based on stakeholder feedback.\nWhile agility is a wide mindset that is broader than a development framework, agile\napproaches can be considered adaptive. Some agile approaches entail iterations that are1 to 2 weeks in duration with a demonstration of the accomplishments at the end of eachiteration. The project team is very engaged with the planning for each iteration. The projectteam will determine the scope they can achieve based on a prioritized backlog, estimate thework involved, and work collaboratively throughout the iteration to develop the scope.\nAs part of the community center, a project to establish senior services could be developed and \ndeployed iteratively. For example, the first iteration could be a Meals on Wheels program. This could be followed by a transportation service, then group outings and events, caregiver relief, adult day care, and so forth. Each service would be complete on its own and could be deployed when it was available. Each additional service would improve and increase the senior services for the community. \nA project to establish training for community action patrol volunteers could use an incremental \napproach. The training, comprised of basic training, logistics training, and patrol training, can be developed by different people. It can be developed at the same time in modules, or one module can be developed, feedback gathered, and then subsequent modules can be developed. However, the community action patrol training program will only be complete after all the modules are developed, integrated, and deployed.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202139\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.3.4  CONSIDERATIONS FOR SELECTING A DEVELOPMENT APPROACH\nThere are several factors that influence the selection of a development approach. They can \nbe divided into categories of the product, service, or result; the project; and the organization. The \nfollowing subsections describe the variables associated with each category.\n2.3.4.1  Product, Service, or Result\nThere are many variables associated with the nature of the product, service, or result that \ninfluence the development approach. The following list outlines some of the variables to consider when selecting the development approach.\n▶Degree of innovation.  Deliverables where the scope and requirements are well\nunderstood, that the project team has worked with before, and that allow for planningup front are well suited to a predictive approach. Deliverables that have a high degree ofinnovation or where the project team does not have experience are better suited to a moreadaptive approach.\n▶Requirements certainty.  When the requirements are well known and easy to define, a\npredictive approach fits well. When requirements are uncertain, volatile, or complex and areexpected to evolve throughout the project, a more adaptive approach may be",

Deliverables that have a high degree ofinnovation or where the project team does not have experience are better suited to a moreadaptive approach.\n▶Requirements certainty.  When the requirements are well known and easy to define, a\npredictive approach fits well. When requirements are uncertain, volatile, or complex and areexpected to evolve throughout the project, a more adaptive approach may be a better fit.\nThe community center will need a website so community members can access information \nfrom their home computer, phone, or tablet. The high-level requirements, design, and page layouts can be defined up front. An initial set of information can be deployed on the website. User feedback, new services, and internal stakeholder needs would provide content for a backlog. The backlog information would be prioritized, and the web team would develop and deploy new content. As new requirements and new scope emerge, the estimates for the work would be developed, the work would be done, and once tested, it would be demonstrated for stakeholders. If approved, the work would be deployed to the website. \nPMI Seventh Edition July 202140\nPMBOK® Guide▶Scope stability.  If the scope of the deliverable is stable and not likely to change, a predictive\napproach is useful. If the scope is expected to have many changes, an approach that is closer\nto the adaptive side of the spectrum can be useful.\n▶Ease of change. Related to the requirements certainty and the scope stability, if the natureof the deliverable makes it difficult to manage and incorporate changes, then a predictiveapproach is best. Deliverables that can adapt easily to change can use an approach that ismore adaptive.\n▶Delivery options.  As described in Section 2.3.2 on Delivery Cadence, the nature of the\ndeliverable and whether it can be delivered in components influences the developmentapproach. Products, services, or results that can be developed and/or delivered in piecesare aligned with incremental, iterative, or adaptive approaches. Some large projectsmay be planned using a predictive approach, but there may be some pieces that can bedeveloped and delivered incrementally.\n▶Risk. Products that are inherently high risk require analysis before choosing thedevelopment approach. Some high-risk products may require significant up-front planningand rigorous processes to reduce threats. Other products can reduce risk by building themmodularly and adapting the design and development based on learning to take advantageof emerging opportunities or reduce the exposure to threats.\n▶Safety requirements.  Products that have rigorous safety requirements often use a\npredictive approach as there is a need for significant up-front planning to ensure that allthe safety requirements are identified, planned for, created, integrated, and tested.\n▶Regulations.  Environments that have significant regulatory oversight may need to use a\npredictive approach due to the required process, documentation, and demonstration needs.\n2.3.4.2  Project\nProject variables that influence the development approach are centered around stakeholders, \nschedule constraints, and funding availability.\n▶Stakeholders.  Projects that use adaptive methods require significant stakeholder\ninvolvement throughout the process. Certain stakeholders, such as the product owner,\nplay a substantial role in establishing and prioritizing work.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202141\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains▶Schedule constraints.  If there is a need to deliver something early, even if it is not\na finished product, an iterative or adaptive approach is beneficial.\n▶Funding availability.  Projects that work in an environment of funding uncertainty can\nbenefit from an adaptive or iterative approach. A minimum viable product can be released\nwith less investment than an elaborate product. This allows for market testing or marketcapture with minimum investment. Further investments can be made based on the marketresponse to the product or service.\n2.3.4.3  Organization\nOrganizational variables such as the structure, culture, capability, project team size, and \nlocation influence the development approach.\n▶Organizational structure.  An organizational structure that has many levels, a rigid\nreporting structure, and substantial bureaucracy frequently uses a predictive approach.Projects that use adaptive methods tend to have a flat structure and may operate with self-organizing project teams.\n▶Culture. A predictive approach fits better in an organization with a culture of managingand directing, where the work is planned out and progress is measured against baselines.Adaptive approaches fit better within an organization that emphasizes project team self-management.\n▶Organizational capability.  Transitioning from predictive development approaches to\nadaptive approaches and then to using agile methods is more than just stating that theorganization will now be agile. It entails shifting the mindset starting at the executive levelthroughout the organization. Organizational policies, ways of working, reporting structure,and attitude should all be aligned in order to employ adaptive methods successfully.\n▶Project team size and location.  Adaptive approaches, especially agile methods, often\nwork better with project teams of 7 ± 2. Adaptive approaches also favor project teams thatare located in the same physical space. Large project teams and project teams that aremostly virtual may do better by using an approach that is closer to the predictive side of thespectrum. However, there are approaches that seek to scale up the adaptive approaches towork with large and dispersed project teams.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202142\nPMBOK® Guide2.3.5  LIFE CYCLE AND PHASE DEFINITIONS\nThe type and number of project phases in a project life cycle depend upon many variables, \nchief among them the delivery cadence and the development approach, as described previously. \nExamples of phases in a life cycle include:\n▶Feasibility.

This phase determines if the business case is valid and if the organization has\nthe capability to deliver the intended outcome.\n▶Design. Planning and analysis lead to the design of the project deliverable that will bedeveloped.\n▶Build. Construction of the deliverable with integrated quality assurance activities isconducted.\n▶Test.

Project deliverables are put into use and transitional activities required forsustainment, benefits realization, and organizational change management are completed.\n▶Close.  The project is closed, project knowledge and artifacts are archived, project team\nmembers are released, and contracts are closed.\nProject phases often have a phase gate review (also known as stage gate) to check that the \ndesired outcomes or exit criteria for the phase have been achieved before proceeding to the next phase. Exit criteria may tie to acceptance criteria for deliverables, contractual obligations, meeting specific performance targets, or other tangible measures.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202143\nSection 2 – Project Performance DomainsFigure 2-9 shows a life cycle where one phase finishes before the next one begins. This type of \nlife cycle would fit well with a predictive development approach since each phase is only performed \nonce, and each phase focuses on a particular type of work. However, there are situations, such as adding scope, a change in requirements, or a change in the market that cause phases to be repeated.\nSample Predictive Life Cycle\nFeasibility\nDesign\nBuild\nTest\nDeploy\nClose\nFigure 2-9.

Life Cycle with an Incremental Development Approach\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202145\nSection 2 – Project Performance DomainsFigure 2-11 shows a life cycle using an adaptive development approach. At the end of each \niteration (sometimes known as a sprint ), the customer reviews a functional deliverable. At the review, \nthe key stakeholders provide feedback, and the project team updates the project backlog of features \nand functions to prioritize for the next iteration.\nThis approach can be modified for use in continuous delivery situations, as described in \nSection 2.3.2 on Delivery Cadence.\nSeveral adaptive methodologies, including agile, use flow-based scheduling, which does not use \na life cycle or phases. One goal is to optimize the flow of deliveries based on resource capacity, materials, and other inputs. Another goal is to minimize time and resource waste and optimize the efficiency of processes and the throughput of deliverables. Projects that use these practices and methods usually adopt them from the Kanban scheduling system used in lean and just-in-time scheduling approaches. \nLife Cycle Using Adaptive Development Approach\nIteration 1 Iteration 2 Iteration 3\nFeedbac k\nBacklog\nPrioritizationFeedbac k\nBacklog\nPrioritizationDefine Project\nand\nProduct V ision\nFigure 2-11.

In this example, there \nare four products and services: the building, the community action patrol (CAP) training, the senior services, and the website. Table 2-4 describes the delivery cadence and the development approach.\nBased on this information, a potential life cycle might be:\n▶Start Up. Entry criteria for this phase are that the business case has been approved andthe project charter has been authorized. In this phase, the high-level roadmap is developed,initial funding requirements are established, project team and resource requirements aredefined, a milestone schedule is created, and planning for a procurement strategy is defined.These deliverables should be complete prior to exiting the start-up phase. Exit criteria will bereviewed at an origination phase gate review.\n▶Plan. In this phase, the high-level information for the building is decomposed into detailedplans. A detailed design document for the CAP training is completed. An analysis of thesenior services offering is completed along with a gap analysis. The initial wireframe forthe website is created. These deliverables should be complete prior to exiting the planningphase. Exit criteria will be reviewed at a planning phase gate review.Table 2-4.

The \nlife cycle selected impacts the way in which planning is undertaken. Predictive life cycles undertake the bulk of the planning up front and then continue to replan by using rolling wave planning and progressive elaboration. Plans are also updated as threats and opportunities materialize.\nThe development approach and delivery cadence is one way to reduce uncertainty on projects. \nA deliverable that has a lot of risk associated with meeting regulatory requirements may choose a predictive approach to build in extra testing, documentation, and robust processes and procedures. A deliverable that has a lot of risk associated with stakeholder acceptance may choose an iterative approach and release a minimum viable product to the market to get feedback before developing additional features and functions.\nWhat’s in a Name?  Not all project practitioners differentiate between the development \napproach and the life cycle. Some practitioners will say a project follows an agile life cycle when they are actually talking about the development approach. Some practitioners refer to predictive approaches as waterfall. Adaptive development approaches may also be known as evolutionary approaches.\nBecause project management is evolving, the language used continues to evolve. The best \nway to understand what a person is referring to is to determine how they are developing deliverables and ask them the names of the phases in the life cycle. This can help frame the project and understand how people are using terms. \nPMI Seventh Edition July 202150\nPMBOK® GuideThe Development Approach and Life Cycle Performance Domain has significant overlap with \nthe Delivery Performance Domain when considering delivery cadence and development approach. \nThe delivery cadence is one of the main drivers of delivering value in alignment with the business case and the benefits realization plans. Eliciting the product requirements and meeting the quality requirements as described in the Delivery Performance Domain have a significant influence on the development approach.\nThe Team Performance Domain and the Development Approach and Life Cycle Performance \nDomain interact when it comes to project team capabilities and project team leadership skills. The project team’s way of working and the project manager’s style vary significantly depending on the development approach. A predictive approach usually entails more emphasis on up-front planning, measurement, and control. On the other end of the spectrum, an adaptive approach, especially when using agile methods, requires more of a servant leadership style and may have self-managing project teams.\n2.3.8  MEASURING OUTCOMES\nTable 2-5 identifies the outcomes on the left and ways of checking them on the right",

Planning Performance Domain\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202152\nPMBOK® Guide2.4.1  PLANNING OVERVIEW\nThe purpose of planning is to proactively develop an approach to create the project \ndeliverables. The project deliverables drive the outcomes the project was undertaken to achieve. \nHigh-level planning may begin prior to project authorization. The project team progressively elaborates initial project documents, such as a vision statement, project charter, business case,  \nor similar documents to identify or define a coordinated path to achieve the desired outcomes.\nThe following definitions are relevant to the Planning Performance Domain:\nEstimate. A quantitative assessment of the likely amount or outcome of a variable, such as project costs, resources, effort, or durations.\nAccuracy.  Within the quality management system, accuracy is an assessment of correctness.\nPrecision.  Within the quality management system, precision is an assessment of exactness.\nCrashing.  A method used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost  \nby adding resources.Fast Tracking.  A schedule compression method in which activities or phases normally done \nin sequence are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration.Budget.\n The approved estimate for the project or any work breakdown structure (WBS) \ncomponent or any schedule activity. \nPMI Seventh Edition July 202153\nSection 2 – Project Performance DomainsThe amount of time spent planning, both up front and throughout the project, should be \ndetermined by the circumstances. It is inefficient to spend more time planning than is needed. \nTherefore, the information gained from planning should be sufficient to move forward in an appropriate manner but not more detailed than necessary. Project teams use planning artifacts to confirm stakeholder expectations and provide stakeholders with the information they need to make decisions, take action, and maintain alignment between the project and stakeholders.\n2.4.2  PLANNING VARIABLES\nBecause each project is unique, the amount, timing, and frequency of planning varies. Variables \nthat influence how project planning is conducted include, but are not limited to:\n▶Development approach.  The development approach can influence how, how much, and\nwhen planning is conducted. Examples include:\n▹A specific phase for planning or organizing early in the life cycle. In these situations, much\nof the planning is performed up front. The initial plans are progressively elaborated withmore detail throughout the project, but there is little change to the original scope.\n▹An approach with high-level planning up front, followed by a design phase where\nprototyping is used. After the project team and stakeholders agree to the design,\nthe project team completes more detailed planning.\n▹Adaptive approaches where the project team conducts iterations. Some planning\noccurs up front to establish release plans and further planning occurs at thebeginning of each iteration.\nIt is becoming more common for initial planning to consider social and environmental impacts \nin addition to the financial impacts (sometimes referred to as the triple bottom line). This may take the form of a product life cycle assessment which evaluates the potential environmental impacts of a product, process, or system. The product life cycle assessment informs the design of products and processes. It considers the impacts of materials and processes with regards to sustainability, toxicity, and the environment. \nPMI Seventh Edition July 202154\nPMBOK® Guide▶Project deliverables.

Often the project deliverables necessitate planning in a specific way.\nConstruction projects require significant up-front planning to account for design, approvals,\nmaterials purchasing, logistics, and delivery. Product development or high-technologyprojects may use continuous and adaptive planning to allow for evolution and changesbased on stakeholder feedback and technological advances.\n▶Organizational requirements.  Organizational governance, policies, procedures, processes,\nand culture may require project managers to produce specific planning artifacts.\n▶Market conditions.  Product development projects can take place in a highly competitive\nenvironment. In these situations, project teams can undertake a minimum amount ofup-front planning as the emphasis is on speed to market. The cost of delay that extensiveplanning entails exceeds the risk of potential rework.\n▶Legal or regulatory restrictions.  Regulatory agencies or statutes may require specific\nplanning documents before granting an authorization to proceed or to secure approval torelease the project deliverable into the market.\n2.4.2.1 Delivery\nPlanning begins with understanding the business case, stakeholder requirements, and the \nproject and product scope. Product scope  is the features and functions that characterize a product, \nservice, or result. Project scope  is the work performed to deliver a product, service, or result with the \nspecified features and functions.\nPredictive planning approaches start with the high-level project deliverables up front and \ndecompose them into more detail. This approach can employ a scope statement and/or a work \nbreakdown structure (WBS) to decompose the scope into lower levels of detail.\nProjects that use iterative or incremental approaches can have high-level themes or epics \nthat are decomposed into features, which are then further decomposed into user stories and \nother backlog items. Work that is unique, significant, risky, or novel can be prioritized to reduce the \nuncertainty associated with project scope at the start of the project before signi ficant investment has \ntaken place. Project teams plan routine work based on the concept of last responsible moment. This \napproach defers a decision to allow the project team to consider multiple options until the cost of \nfurther delay would exceed the benefit. It reduces waste by not expending time in developing plans \nfor work that may change or may not be needed.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202155\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.4.2.2  Estimating\nPlanning entails developing estimates for work effort, duration, costs, people, and physical \nresources. Estimates are a quantitative assessment of the likely amount or outcome of a variable, \nsuch as project costs, resources, effort, or duration. As the project evolves, the estimates can change based on current information and circumstances. The project’s phase in the life cycle impacts four aspects associated with estimating:\n▶Range. Estimates tend to have a broad range at the start of the project when there is notmuch information about the project and product scope, stakeholders, requirements, risks,and other information. Figure 2-14 shows a range of -25 to +75% at the start of exploring\na project opportunity. Projects that are well along in their life cycle may have an estimatingrange of -5 to +10%.\n▶Accuracy. Accuracy refers to the correctness of an estimate. Accuracy is linked to range\nin that the lower the accuracy, the larger the potential range of values. An estimate\nat the start of the project will have less accuracy than one that is developed halfwaythrough the project.\n▶Precision.  Precision is different from accuracy (see Figure 2-15). Precision refers to the\ndegree of exactness associated with the estimate. For example, an estimate of 2 days ismore precise than “sometime this week.” The precision of estimates should be compatiblewith the desired accuracy.\n▶Confidence. Confidence increases with experience. Experience working on a previous,similar project can help with the level of confidence required. For new and evolvingtechnology components, the confidence in estimates is expected to be low.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202156\nPMBOK® GuideTimeRange75%\n50%25%\n0%\n-25%\nFigure 2-14.

Low Accuracy, High Precision\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202157\nSection 2 – Project Performance DomainsThere are different ways of presenting and/or adjusting estimates:\n▶Deterministic and probabilistic estimating.  Deterministic estimates, also known as\npoint estimates, present a single number or amount, such as 36 months.\nProbabilistic estimates include a range of estimates along with the associated probabilities\nwithin the range. They can be developed manually by (a) developing a weighted averagebased on multiple likely outcomes, or (b) running a simulation to develop a probabilityanalysis of a particular outcome, usually in terms of cost or schedule.\n▶Absolute and relative estimating.  Absolute estimates are specific information and use\nactual numbers. An absolute estimate for effort might be shown as 120 hours of work. Oneperson working full time could accomplish the work in 15 workdays, assuming 8 hours ofproductivity per workday.\nWhile absolute estimates are specific, relative estimates are shown in comparison to other\nestimates. Relative estimates only have meaning within a given context.\nA probabilistic estimate derived from a computer simulation has three associated factors:\n1.A point estimate with a range such as 36 months +3 months",

Relative estimates only have meaning within a given context.\nA probabilistic estimate derived from a computer simulation has three associated factors:\n1.A point estimate with a range such as 36 months +3 months/-1 month.\n2.A statement of confidence such as a 95% confidence level.\n3.A probability distribution describing the dispersion of the data within and around the given range.\nTogether these three items form a complete metric describing a probabilistic estimate. \nPMI Seventh Edition July 202158\nPMBOK® Guide▶Flow-based estimating.  Flow-based estimates are developed by determining the cycle\ntime and throughput. Cycle time is the total elapsed time it takes one unit to get through a\nprocess. Throughput is the number of items that can complete a process in a given amountof time. These two numbers can provide an estimate to complete a specified quantity of work.\n▶Adjusting estimates for uncertainty.  Estimates are inherently uncertain. Uncertainty\nby definition is associated with risk. Key deliverable dates or budget estimates may\nbe adjusted, or contingency time or funds may be added, based on the outcomes\nof a simulation conducted to establish the range of uncertainty for these parameters.\n2.4.2.3  Schedules\nA schedule is a model for executing the project’s activities, including durations, dependencies, \nand other planning information. Schedule planning can use predictive or adaptive approaches.\nPredictive approaches follow a stepwise process as follows:\n▶Step 1. Decompose the project scope into specific activities.\n▶Step 2. Sequence related activities.\n▶Step 3. Estimate the effort, duration, people, and physical resources required to completethe activities.\n▶Step 4. Allocate people and resources to the activities based on availability.\n▶Step 5. Adjust the sequence, estimates, and resources until an agreed-upon schedule\nis achieved.\nOne form of relative estimating is planning poker. In planning poker, the project team performing \nthe work comes to a consensus on the effort that is necessary to deliver value. Using story  \npoints to estimate work could result in 64 story points being assigned for that work. New work  \nis estimated using the amount of estimated work compared to points assigned to previous work. Therefore, new work effort is compared to previously known work effort. \nPMI Seventh Edition July 202159\nSection 2 – Project Performance DomainsIf the schedule model does not meet the initial desired end date, schedule compression \nmethods are applied. Crashing is a schedule compression method that seeks to shorten the duration \nfor the least incremental cost. Crashing can include adding people to activities, working overtime, or paying to expedite deliveries.\nFast tracking is a schedule compression method in which activities or tasks that are normally \ndone in sequence are performed in parallel, at least for a portion of their duration. Fast tracking often entails applying leads and lags along a network path. A lead is where the work of a successor \nactivity is accelerated, such as starting a successor activity before the predecessor has finished. In Figure 2-16, there is a lead between the finish of Task 2 and the start of Task 4.\nA lag is a delay of a successor activity. An example of using a lag would be changing the type \nof relationship between activities, and then applying a lag. For example, rather than waiting for an activity to finish before the next one starts (a finish-to-start relationship), change the relationship to have the end of the successor activity finish a determined amount of time after the end of the predecessor (a finish-to-finish relationship). The network logic would show a lag between the finish of the predecessor and the finish of the successor activities. There is an example of a finish-to-finish relationship with a lag in Figure 2-16 between Task 8 and Task 7. A lag can also be applied between the start of one activity and the start of another activity (a start-to-start relationship).\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202160\nPMBOK® GuideWhen compressing the schedule, it is important to determine the nature of the dependencies \nbetween activities. Some activities cannot be fast tracked due to the nature of the work—others can. \nThe four types of dependencies are:\n▶Mandatory dependency. A relationship that is contractually required or inherent in thenature of the work. This type of dependency usually cannot be modified.\n▶Discretionary dependency.  A relationship that is based on best practices or project\npreferences. This type of dependency may be modifiable.\n▶External dependency.  A relationship between project activities and non-project activities.\nThis type of dependency usually cannot be modified.\n▶Internal dependency.  A relationship between one or more project activities. This type\nof dependency may be modifiable.Activity 1\nActivity 2Activity 3Activity 4Activity 5Activity 6Activity 7Activity 8\nEndMy Project\n1     2    3    4     5     6     7     8     9    10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24\nFS–1\nFF+1\nFigure 2-16.

One such scheduling approach is \nbased on iterations and releases (see Figure 2-17). A high-level release plan is developed that \nindicates the basic features and functionality to be included in each release. Within each release, there will be two or more iterations. Each iteration adds business and/or stakeholder value. Value may include features, risk reduction, experimentation, or other ways of delivering or protecting value. The planning for the work in future releases is kept at a high level so the project team does not engage in planning that could change based on feedback from earlier releases.\nRelease 3 Release 2 Release 1\nRelease Plan\nIteration PlanIteration 0 Iteration 1 Iteration 2 Iteration 3 Iteration n\nFeature D\n(User Story 5)Feature C\n(User Story 4)Feature B\n(User Story 3)Feature A\n(User Story 2)Feature A\n(User Story 1)\n5 Hours\n8 Hours4 Hours\n12 HoursTask A\nTask B\nTask C\nTask DProduct vision drives\nproduct roadmap\nProduct roadmap\ndrives release plans\nRelease plan\nestablishes the iterations\nIteration plans\nschedule featuredevelopment\nTasks (estimated in\nhours) created todeliver user storiesPrioritized features\ndelivered by  user\nstories (estimatedin story points)\nFigure 2-17. Release and Iteration Plan\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202162\nPMBOK® GuideAdaptive approaches often use timeboxes. The work in each timebox is based on a prioritized \nbacklog. The project team determines the amount of work they can do in each timebox, estimates \nthe work, and self-manages to accomplish the work. At the end of the timebox, the project team \ndemonstrates the work completed. At that point, the backlog and estimates of work available to be \ndone may be updated or reprioritized for the next timebox.\nDetermining the schedule involves using the information in the estimating section to determine \noverall duration and effort estimates. Regardless of the scheduling approach used, the relationship \nbetween effort and duration needs to be addressed. Some activities are effort driven, which means \nthat the duration can be reduced by adding people. This approach can work up to a point, after  \nwhich adding people might actually extend duration. Framing a building is e ffort driven. If more \npeople are added, the duration can be reduced. Some activities are fixed duration, such as running  \na test or conducting employee training.\nThe nature of the work determines  if and how much the duration c an be reduced by adding \npeople before increasing the time due  to coordination, communicatio n, conflict, and potential rework. \nThere is no fixed formula to determine the reduction in duration due to  the addition of people.\n2.4.2.4 Budget\nThe project budget evolves from the agreed estimates for the project. The information in \nSection 2.4.2.2 on Estimating is applied to project costs to develop cost estimates. Cost estimates \nare then aggregated to develop the cost baseline. The cost baseline is often allocated across the \nproject schedule to reflect when the costs will be incurred. This practice allows project managers to \nbalance the funds approved in a specific budget period with the scheduled work. If there are funding \nlimitations for a budget period, the work may need to be rescheduled to meet those limitations.\nThe project budget should include contingency reserve funds to allow for uncertainty. \nContingency reserves are set aside to implement a risk response or to respond to risk events \nshould they occur.\nManagement reserves are set aside for unexpected activities relate d to in-scope work. Depending \non the organization’s policies and organizational structure, manage ment reserves may be managed \nby the project, t he sponsor, product owner, or the PMO at the program and portfolio level. Figure 2-18 \nshows the budge t build up.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202163\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.4.3  PROJECT TEAM COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE\nPlanning for project team2 composition begins with identifying the skill sets required to accomplish \nthe project work. This entails evaluating not only the skills, but also the level of proficiency and years  \nof experience in similar projects.\nThere are different cost structures associated with using internal project team members versus \nsecuring them from outside the organization. The benefit that outside skills bring to the project are \nweighed against the costs that will be incurred.\n2 This topic is about planning for the project team.

Small project teams that can work in the same room \nare able to take advantage of osmotic communication and can solve problems as they arise. Some project teams are physically dispersed. Project team members may be in different cities, time zones, or countries.

Communication is the most important factor in engaging with stakeholders effectively. Planning communication for the project entails considering the following:\n▶Who needs information?\n▶What information does each stakeholder need?\n▶Why should information be shared with stakeholders?\n▶What is the best way to provide information?\n▶When and how often is information needed?\n▶Who has the information needed?\nThere may be different categories of information, such as internal and external, sensitive \nand public, or general and detailed. Analyzing the stakeholders, information needs, and categories of information provides the foundation for establishing the communications processes and plans for the project.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202165\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.4.5  PHYSICAL RESOURCES\nPhysical resources apply to any resource that is not a person. It can include materials, \nequipment, software, testing environments, licenses, and so forth. Planning for physical resources \nentails estimating, as described in Section 2.4.2.2, as well as supply chain, logistics, and management. Projects with significant physical resources, such as engineering and construction projects, will need to plan for procurement activities to acquire the resources. This may be as simple as utilizing a basic ordering agreement or as complicated as managing, coordinating, and integrating several large procurement activities.\nPlanning for physical resources includes taking into account lead time for delivery, movement, \nstorage, and disposition of materials, as well as a means to track material inventory from arrival on site to delivery of an integrated product. Project teams whose projects require significant physical materials think and plan strategically about the timing from order, to delivery, to usage. This can include evaluation of bulk ordering versus cost of storage, global logistics, sustainability, and integrating management of physical assets with the rest of the project.\n2.4.6  PROCUREMENT\nProcurements can happen at any time during a project. However, up-front planning helps \nto set expectations that ensure the procurement process is performed smoothly. Once the high-level scope is known, project teams conduct a make-or-buy analysis. This includes identifying those deliverables and services that will be developed in-house, and those that will be purchased from external sources. This information impacts the project team and the schedule. Contracting professionals need advance information on the type of goods needed, when they will be needed, and any technical specifications required for the procured goods or services.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202166\nPMBOK® Guide2.4.7  CHANGES\nThere will be changes througho ut the project. Some changes are a result of a risk event \noccurring or a project environment change, some are based on developing a deeper understanding \nof requirements, and others are due to customer requests or other reaso ns. Therefore, project teams \nshould prepare a process for adapting plans throughout the project. This may take the form of a \nchange control process, repriorit izing the backlog, or rebaselining the project. Projects that  have a \ncontractual element may need to fo llow a defined process for contract  changes.\n2.4.8  METRICS\nThere is a natural linkage between planning, delivering, and measuring work. That linkage is \nmetrics. Establishing metrics includes setting the thresholds t hat indicate whether work perfo rmance \nis as expected, trending positively or negatively away from expected performance, or unacceptable. \nDeciding what to measure and how often is best info rmed by the phrase “only measure what mat ters.”\nMetrics associated with the product are specific to the deliverables being developed. Metrics \nassociated with schedule and budget performance are often driven by organizational standards \nand are related to a baseline or an approved version of the schedule or budget against which actual \nresults are compared.\nAs part of planning, the metrics, baselines, and thresholds for performance are established, as \nwell as any test and evaluation processes and procedures that will be used to measure performance \nto the specification of the project deliverable. The metrics, baselines, and tests are used as the basis \nto evaluate variance of actual performance as part of the Measurement Performance Domain.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202167\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.4.9  ALIGNMENT\nPlanning activities and artifacts need to remain integrated throughout the project. This means \nthat planning for the performance in terms of scope and quality requirements aligns with delivery \ncommitments, allocated funds, type and availability of resources, the uncertainty inherent in the project, and stakeholder needs. Project teams can require additional planning artifacts depending on the type of project. For example, logistics plans will need to integrate with material and delivery needs, testing plans will need to align with quality and delivery needs, and so forth.\nWork on one project often occurs in parallel with other projects in a program or a release.  \nThe timing of the work of a single project should align with the needs of the work on related projects and the operations work of the organization.\nLarge projects may combine the planning artifacts into an integrated project management \nplan. For smaller projects, a detailed project management plan will be inefficient. Regardless of the timing, frequency, and degree of planning, the various aspects of the project need to remain aligned and integrated.\n2.4.10  INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nPlanning occurs throughout the project and integrates with each performance domain.

At the \nstart of the project, the expected outcomes are identified and high-level plans to achieve them are developed. Depending on the selected development approach and life cycle, intensive planning may be conducted up front, and then plans may be adjusted to reflect the actual environment. Other life cycles encourage just enough planning at various points throughout the project with the expectation that plans will evolve.\nThroughout the project, planning guides the project work, delivery of outcomes, and business \nvalue. Project teams and stakeholders establish measures of progress and success, and performance is compared to plans. Uncertainty and planning interact as project teams plan for how to address uncertainty and risks. Plans may need to be revised or new plans developed to account for events or conditions that emerge. The project team members, environment, and project details influence plans for working effectively with the project team and engaging proactively with stakeholders.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202168\nPMBOK® Guide2.4.11  CHECKING RESULTS\nTable 2-6 identifies the outcomes on the left and ways of checking them on the right.\nTable 2-6.

Time spent tracking conformance to process is time the project team cannot spend on delivering the outcomes for which the project was commissioned. Therefore, project teams utilize just enough time reviewing process conformance to maximize the benefits delivered from the review while still satisfying the governance needs of process.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202172\nPMBOK® GuideIn addition to being efficient, processes should be effective. This means they need to comply \nwith quality requirements, regulations, standards, and organizational policies in addition to \nproducing the desired outcome. Process evaluation can include process audits and quality assurance activities to ensure processes are being followed and are accomplishing the intended outcomes.\n2.5.2  BALANCING COMPETING CONSTRAINTS\nSuccessfully leading a project includes understanding the constraints associated with the work. \nConstraints can take the form of fixed delivery dates, compliance to regulatory codes, a predetermined budget, quality policies, considerations of the triple bottom line, and so forth. The constraints may shift and change throughout the project. A new stakeholder requirement may entail expanding the schedule and budget. A reduction in budget may entail relaxing a quality requirement or reducing scope.\nBalancing these shifting constraints, while maintaining stakeholder satisfaction, is an ongoing \nproject activity. At times, it may include meeting with the customer, sponsor, or product owner to present alternatives and implications. Other times, the decisions and potential variances may be within the project team’s authority to make trade-offs to deliver the end result. Either way, this balancing activity is ongoing throughout the project.\nExample of non-value-added work.  A PMO wants to track the type of work project team \nmembers are doing. They ask the project team to record the type of work they are doing in specific categories on their time sheets. The time taken to categorize and record their time can be viewed as non-value-added work. \nPMI Seventh Edition July 202173\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.5.3  MAINTAINING PROJECT TEAM FOCUS\nProject managers have a responsibility for assessing and balancing the project team focus and \nattention. This involves evaluating short- and long-term projections of progress toward delivery goals.\nLeading the project team includes balancing the workload and assessing if project team members \nare satisfied with their work so they remain motivated. To maximize business and stakeholder value \ndelivered throughout the project, project team attention needs to be kept in a healthy balance. Leading with a goal of maximizing overall delivered value involves focusing on production (delivering value) and protecting the project team’s production capability (project team health and satisfaction). The goal is to keep the project team focused on delivering value and maintain awareness of when potential issues, delays, and cost overruns enter the project.\n2.5.4  PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT\nMuch of the project work is associated with communication and engagement, especially work \nassociated with maintaining project team member and other stakeholder engagement. As described in the Stakeholder Performance Domain, communication entails formal and informal communication, in addition to verbal and written communication. Information can be collected in meetings, conversations, and by pulling information from electronic repositories. Once collected, it is distributed as indicated in the project management communications plan.\nOn a day-to-day basis, there are ad hoc requests for information, presentations, reports, and \nother forms of communication. An abundance of ad hoc communication requests may indicate that the communication planning was not sufficient to meet stakeholder needs. In this situation, further stakeholder engagement may be necessary to ensure stakeholder information requirements are met.\n2.5.5  MANAGING PHYSICAL RESOURCES\nSome projects require materials and supplies from third parties. Planning, ordering, transporting, \nstoring, tracking, and controlling these physical resources can take a large amount of time and effort.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202174\nPMBOK® GuideLarge amounts of physical resources require an integrated logistics system. This is usually \ndocumented in company policies that are then implemented in projects. A logistics plan describes \nhow the company policy will be implemented on the project. Supporting documentation includes estimates for the type of material, basis of estimates, expected usage over time, specifications for grade, and the time and location for deliveries.\nThe objectives from a physical resource perspective are to:\n▶Reduce or eliminate the material handling and storage on site,\n▶Eliminate wait times for materials,\n▶Minimize scrap and waste, and\n▶Facilitate a safe work environment.\nAll of this work is integrated with the master project schedule to provide clear expectations and \ncommunications for all parties involved.\n2.5.6  WORKING WITH PROCUREMENTS\nMany projects involve some form of contracting or procurement.

Procurement can cover \neverything from material, capital equipment, and supplies to solutions, labor, and services. In most organizations, project managers do not have contracting authority. Rather, they work with contracting officers or other people with expertise in contracts, laws, and regulations. Organizations usually have rigorous policies and procedures associated with procurements. The policies identify who has authority to enter into a contract, the limits of authority, and the processes and procedures that should be followed.\nPrior to conducting a procurement, the project manager and technically qualified project team \nmembers work with contracting professionals to develop the request for proposals (RFP), statement of work (SOW), terms and conditions, and other necessary documents to go out to bid.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202175\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.5.6.1  The Bid Process\nThe bid process includes developing and publicizing bid documents, bidder conferences, and \nselecting a bidder.\nBid documents can include:\n▶Request for information.  A request for information is used to gather more information\nfrom the market prior to sending out bid documents to a set of selected vendors.\n▶Request for proposal.  This bid document is used for complex or complicated scope where\nthe buyer is looking for the vendor to provide a solution.\n▶Request for quote.  This bid document is used when price is the main deciding factor, and\nthe proposed solution is readily available.\nThese three types cover the majority of bidding needs. There are other bid documents; \nhowever, they tend to be industry specific.\nOnce the bid documents are distributed, the buyer generally has a bidder conference to \nrespond to bidder questions and provide clarifying information. Then the bidders develop their \nresponses and deliver them to the buyer by the date specified in the bid documents.\nChoosing the best vendor, sometimes known as source selection, is often based on a number \nof criteria, such as experience, references, price, and timely delivery. These variables may be weighted to reflect the relative importance of each. The buyer evaluates vendor bids against the criteria to select an appropriate vendor(s). The buyer and vendor negotiate terms and conditions. Most everything can be negotiated, from cost to delivery and payment dates, to location of work, ownership of intellectual property, and so forth.\n2.5.6.2  Contracting\nEventually, the parties reach agreement and enter into a contract. The type of contracting \nvehicle depends on the size of the purchase, the stability of the scope of work, and the risk tolerances of the organizations.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202176\nPMBOK® GuideOnce the vendor is selected, the project plans and documents are updated to incorporate \nvendor dates, resources, costs, quality requirements, risks, etc. From that point, the vendor becomes \na project stakeholder. Information in the Stakeholders Performance Domain and Measurement Performance Domain will apply to the vendor(s) throughout the project.\nProcurements can take place at any point during the project. All procurement activities are \nintegrated into the project operations.\n2.5.7  MONITORING NEW WORK AND CHANGES\nIn adaptive projects, there is an expectation that work will evolve and adapt. As a result, new \nwork can be added to the product backlog, as needed. However, if more work is added than is being completed, or if the same amount of work is added that is being completed, the project will continue without end. The project manager works with the product owner to manage expectations around adding scope, the implications to the budget, and the availability of project team members. The product owner prioritizes the project backlog on an ongoing basis so that high-priority items are completed. If the schedule or budget is constrained, the product owner may consider the project done when the highest priority items are delivered.\nFor projects that use an adaptive approach for some deliverables and a predictive approach  \nfor others, a master agreement may be used for the overall contract. The adaptive work may be placed in an appendix or supplement. This allows the changes to occur on the adaptive scope without impacting the overall contract. \nPMI Seventh Edition July 202177\nSection 2 – Project Performance DomainsIn predictive projects, the project team actively manages changes to the work to ensure only \napproved changes are included in the scope baseline. Any changes to the scope are then accompanied \nby appropriate changes to the people, resources, schedule, and budget. Scope changes can add to uncertainty; therefore, any change requests should be accompanied by an evaluation of any new risks that are introduced due to the addition to or change in scope. The project manager works with the change control board and the change requestor to guide change requests through the change control process. Approved changes are integrated into the applicable project planning documents, product backlog, and project scope. The changes are also communicated to the appropriate stakeholders.\n2.5.8  LEARNING THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT\nPeriodically, the project team may meet to determine what they can do better in the future \n(lessons learned) and how they can improve and challenge the process in upcoming iterations (retrospectives). Ways of working can evolve to produce better outcomes.\n2.5.8.1  Knowledge Management\nA lot of learning takes place during projects. Some of the learning is project specific, such as \na faster way to accomplish specific work.

Some of the learning is project specific, such as \na faster way to accomplish specific work. Some learning can be shared with other project teams to improve outcomes, such as a quality assurance approach that results in fewer defects. Still other learning can be shared throughout the organization, such as training users how to work with a new software application.\n2.5.8.2  Explicit and Tacit Knowledge\nThroughout the project, project teams develop and share explicit knowledge. Explicit \nknowledge can be readily codified using words, pictures, or numbers. For example, the steps to a new process are explicit knowledge that can be documented. Explicit knowledge can be distributed using information management tools to connect people to information, such as manuals, registers, web searches, and databases.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202178\nPMBOK® GuideAnother type of knowledge is tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is challenging to express as it \ncannot be codified. Tacit knowledge is comprised of experience, insights, and practical knowledge or \nskill. Tacit knowledge is shared by connecting the people who need the knowledge with people who have the knowledge. This can be accomplished via networking, interviews, job shadowing, discussion forums, workshops, or other similar methods.\nBecause projects are temporary endeavors, much of the knowledge is lost once the project is \ncompleted. Being attentive to knowledge transfer serves the organization by not only delivering the value that the project was undertaken to achieve, it also allows the organization to gain knowledge from the experience of running projects.\n2.5.9  INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nThe Project Work Performance Domain interacts and enables other performance domains \non the project. Project work enables and supports efficient and effective planning, delivery, and measurement. It provides the environment for project team meetings, interactions, and stakeholder engagement to be effective. Project work supports navigating uncertainty, ambiguity, and complexity; and it balances their impacts with the other project constraints.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202179\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.5.10  CHECKING RESULTS\nTable 2-7 identifies the outcomes on the left and ways of checking them on the right.\nTable 2-7. Checking Outcomes—Project Work Performance Domain\nOutcome Check\nEfficient and effective project \nperformance\nProject processes that are \nappropriate for the project and the environment\nAppropriate communication and \nengagement with stakeholders\nEfficient management of physical \nresources\nEffective management of \nprocurements\nEffective handling of change\nImproved capability due to \ncontinuous learning and process improvementStatus reports show that project work is efficient and effective.\nEvidence shows that the project processes ha ve been tailored to meet the \nneeds of the project and the environment.

There are few ad hoc requests for information or misunderstand-ings that might indicate engagement and communication activities are not effective.\nThe amount of material used, scrap discarded, and amount of rework indicate \nthat resources are being used efficiently.\nA procurement audit demonstrates that appropriate processes utilized were \nsufficient for the procurement and that the contractor is performing to plan.\nProjects using a predictive approach ha ve a change log that demonstrates \nchanges are being ev aluated holistically with consideration for scope, \nschedule, budget, resource, stakeholder , and risk impacts. Projects using an \nadaptive approach ha ve a backlog that shows the rate of accomplishing \nscope and the rate of adding new scope.Team status reports show fewer errors and rework with an increase in velocity.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202180\nPMBOK® Guide2.6 DELIVERY PERFORMANCE DOMAIN\nProjects support strategy execution and the advancement of business objectives. Project \ndelivery focuses on meeting requirements, scope, and quality expectations to produce the expected \ndeliverables that will drive the intended outcomes.DELIVERY PERFORMANCE DOMAIN\nProjects contribute to business objectives and ad vancement \nof strateg y.\nProjects realize the outcomes they  were initiated to delive r.\nProject benefits are realized in the time frame in wh ich they  \nwere planned.\nThe project team has a clear understanding of requirements.\nStakeholders accept and are satisfied with project \ndeliverables.The Delivery P erformance \nDomain addresses \nactivities and functions associated with delivering the scope and quality that the project was under taken to achieve.Effective  execution of this performance domain results in the \nfollowing desired outcomes:\nFigure 2-20. Delivery Performance Domain\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202181\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains\nThe following definitions are relevant to the Delivery Performance Domain:\nRequirement.

Projects often deliver multiple outcomes that stakeholders may value differently. For example, one group may value ease of use or the time-saving aspects of a deliverable while another group values its economic return or market differentiation.\n2.6.1  DELIVERY OF VALUE\nProjects that use a development approach that supports releasing deliverables throughout the \nproject life cycle can start delivering value to the business, customer, or other stakeholders during the project. Projects that deliver the bulk of their deliverable at the end of the project life cycle generate value after the initial deployment.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202182\nPMBOK® GuideBusiness value often continues to be captured long after the initial project has ended. \nFrequently, longer product and program life cycles are used to measure the bene fits and value \ncontributed by earlier projects.\nA business case document often provides the business justification and a projection of \nanticipated business value from a project. The format of this business case varies based on the \ndevelopment approach and life cycle selected. Examples include business case documents with \ndetailed estimates of return on investment or a lean, start-up canvas that describes high-level \nelements such as the problem, solution, revenue streams, and cost structures. These business \ndocuments demonstrate how the project outcomes align with the organization’s business objectives.\nProject-authorizing documents attempt to quantify the project’s desired outcomes to allow for \nperiodic measurement. These documents may range from detailed, baselined plans or high-level \nroadmaps that provide an overview of the project life cycle, major releases, key deliverables, reviews, \nand other top-level information.\n2.6.2  DELIVERABLES\nIn this context, deliverable refers to the interim or final product, service, or results from \na project. The deliverables enable the outcomes that the project was undertaken to create. \nDeliverables reflect the stakeholder requirements, scope, and quality, along with the long-term \nimpacts to profit, people, and the planet.\n2.6.2.1 Requirements\nA requirement is a condition or capability that is necessary to be present in a product, service, \nor result to satisfy a business need. Requirements can be very high level, such as those found \nin a business case, or they can be very detailed, such as those found in acceptance criteria for a \ncomponent of a system.\nProjects that have a well-defined scope, which is relatively stable, generally work with project \nstakeholders to elicit and document the requirements during up-front planning. Projects that have a \nhigh-level understanding of the requirements at the start of a project may evolve those requirements \nover time. Some projects discover requirements during project work.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202183\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains▶Requirements elicitation.  To elicit means to draw out, bring forth, or evoke. There is\nmore to collecting requirements than interviewing or conducting focus groups. Sometimes\nrequirements are drawn out by analyzing data, observing processes, reviewing defect logs,or other methods.\nPart of eliciting requirements is documenting them and gaining stakeholder agreement.\nWell-documented requirements meet the following criteria:\n▹Clear. There is only one way to interpret the requirement.\n▹Concise.  The requirement is stated in as few words as possible.\n▹Verifiable. There is a way to verify that the requirement has been met.\n▹Consistent.  There are no contradictory requirements.\n▹Complete.  The set of requirements represents the entirety of the current project\nor product needs.\n▹Traceable. Each requirement can be recognized by a unique identifier.\n▶Evolving and discovering requirements.  On projects that do not have clearly defined\nrequirements up front, prototypes, demonstrations, storyboards, and mock-ups can beused to evolve the requirements. In these situations, stakeholders are more likely to takean “I’ll know it when I see it” approach to developing requirements. Evolving requirementsare common in projects using iterative, incremental, or adaptive development approaches.In some cases, new opportunities arise that change requirements.\n▶Managing requirements.  Regardless of whether requirements are documented up\nfront, evolved along the way, or discovered, there is a need to manage them. Ineffectiverequirements management can lead to rework, scope creep, customer dissatisfaction,budget overruns, schedule delay, and overall project failure. Therefore, many projectshave one accountable person for requirements management. This person may serve asbusiness analyst, product owner, value engineer, or other title. Those individuals managingrequirements may use specialized software, backlogs, index cards, traceability matrices, orsome other method to ensure there is an appropriate level of requirement flexibility versusstability, and that new and changing requirements are agreed to by all relevant stakeholders.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202184\nPMBOK® Guide2.6.2.2 Scope  Definition\nAs requirements are identified, the scope that will meet them is defined. Scope is the sum of \nthe products, services, and results to be provided as a project. As scope is defined, it creates the need \nfor more requirements identification. Therefore, like requirements, scope can be well defined up front, it can evolve over time, or it can be discovered.\n▶Scope decomposition.  Scope can be elaborated using a scope statement to identify\nthe major deliverables associated with the project and the acceptance criteria for eachdeliverable. Scope can also be elaborated",

Scope can be elaborated using a scope statement to identify\nthe major deliverables associated with the project and the acceptance criteria for eachdeliverable. Scope can also be elaborated by decomposing it into lower levels of detailusing a work breakdown structure (WBS). A WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the totalscope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectivesand create the required deliverables. Each level down in the hierarchy represents a greaterlevel of detail of the deliverable and work required to produce it.\nAnother way to elaborate scope is by identifying the themes of the project in an agile\ncharter, roadmap, or as part of the product hierarchy. Themes represent large groupsof customer value reflected as user stories associated by a common factor, such asfunctionality, data source, or security level. To accomplish themes, the project teamdevelops epics, which are logical containers for a large user story that is too big to completewithin an iteration. Epics may be decomposed into features, a set of related requirementstypically described as a short phrase or function, which represent specific behaviors ofa product. Each feature will have multiple user stories. A user story is a brief descriptionof an outcome for a specific user, which is a promise for a conversation to clarify details.The project team defines story details at the last responsible moment to avoid wastefulplanning should the scope change. The story is a clear and concise representation of\na requirement written from the end user’s perspective.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202185\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains▶Completion of deliverables.  Depending on the approach used, there are different ways\nto describe component or project completion:\n▹Acceptance or completion criteria.  The criteria required to be met before the customer\naccepts the deliverable or before the project is considered complete are often\ndocumented in a scope statement.\n▹Technical performance measures.  The technical specifications for a product may be\ndocumented in a separate specifications document, or they may be documented asan extension to the WBS. This extension, known as a WBS dictionary, elaborates theinformation for each deliverable (work package) in the WBS.\n▹Definition of done. The definition of done is used with adaptive approaches, particularlyin software development projects. It is a checklist of all the criteria required to be metso that a deliverable can be considered ready for customer use.\n2.6.2.3  Moving Targets of Completion\nProjects that operate in uncertain and rapidly changing environments face the situation that  \na “good enough for release” or “done” goal may be subject to change. In markets where competitors are releasing new products frequently, the features planned for a new release may be updated. Likewise, new technology trends, such as mobile devices or wearable devices, might trigger a change in direction or introduce new requirements.\nIn these environments, the definition of the project goal being delivered or “done” is constantly \nmoving. Project teams track the planned rate of project goal achievement relative to the rate of progress toward completion. The longer the project takes to complete, the further the project goal of “done” is likely to move. This is sometimes referred to as “done drift.”\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202186\nPMBOK® Guide\nFigure 2-21 shows a scenario for developing a new smart watch. The initial schedule shows  \n12 months to develop the watch with the initial set of capabilities and features. As competitors \nlaunch similar products, the initial set of capabilities and features increases to stay relevant with the market. This pushes the launch date to Month 14. At 13 months, another competitor launches a product with even more capabilities. Adding these capabilities would delay the launch to Month 16. At some point, a decision will be made whether to release the product as is, even though it doesn’t have the latest features, or continue to update the features prior to launch.\nInitial Shedule\nNew Features\nIdentified\nNew Features\nIdentifiedNew Features\nIdentified\nDone Drift1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 161 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 141 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\nDone Drift\nFigure 2-21. Scenario for Developing a Smart Watch \nPMI Seventh Edition July 202187\nSection 2 – Project Performance DomainsProjects that operate in a more stable environment often face “scope creep.” This is when \nadditional scope or requirements are accepted without adjusting the corresponding schedule, \nbudget, or resource needs. To combat scope creep, project teams use a change control system where all changes are evaluated for the potential value they bring to the project and the potential resources, time, and budget needed to realize the potential value. The project team then presents the changes to the project governance body, product owner, or executive sponsor for formal approval.\n2.6.3  QUALITY\nDelivery is more than just scope and requirements. Scope and requirements focus on what \nneeds to be delivered. Quality focuses on the performance levels that are required to be met. Quality requirements may be reflected in the completion criteria, definition of done, statement of work, or requirements documentation.\nMuch of the costs associated with quality are born by the sponsoring organization and are \nreflected in policies, procedures, and work processes.",

Quality requirements may be reflected in the completion criteria, definition of done, statement of work, or requirements documentation.\nMuch of the costs associated with quality are born by the sponsoring organization and are \nreflected in policies, procedures, and work processes. For example, organizational policies that govern how work is performed and procedures that prescribe work processes are often part of the organization’s quality policy. The cost of overhead, training, and process audit are born by the organization, though they are employed by the project. Inherent in projects is balancing the quality needs of the processes and products with the costs associated with meeting those needs.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202188\nPMBOK® Guide2.6.3.1  Cost of Quality\nThe cost of quality (COQ) methodology is used to find the appropriate balance for investing \nin quality prevention and appraisal to avoid defect or product failures. This model identifies four \ncategories of costs associated with quality: prevention, appraisal, internal failure, and external failure. Prevention and appraisal costs are associated with the cost of compliance to quality requirements. Internal and external failure costs are associated with the cost of noncompliance.\n▶Prevention. Prevention costs are incurred to keep defects and failures out of aproduct. Prevention costs avoid quality problems. They are associated with the design,implementation, and maintenance of the quality management system. They are plannedand incurred before actual operation. Examples include:\n▹Product or service requirements,  such as the establishment of specifications for incoming\nmaterials, processes, finished products, and services;\n▹Quality planning,  such as the creation of plans for quality, reliability, operations,\nproduction, and inspection;\n▹Quality assurance,  such as the creation and maintenance of the quality system; and\n▹Training, such as the development, preparation, and maintenance of programs.\n▶Appraisal.  Appraisal costs are incurred to determine the degree of conformance to\nquality requirements. Appraisal costs are associated with measuring and monitoringactivities related to quality. These costs may be associated with evaluation of purchasedmaterials, processes, products, and services to ensure that they conform to specifications.They could include:\n▹Verification, such as checking incoming material, process setup, and products againstagreed specifications;\n▹Quality audits,  such as confirmation that the quality system is functioning correctly; and\n▹Supplier rating,  such as assessment and approval of suppliers of products and services.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202189\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains▶Internal Failure.  Internal failure costs are associated with finding and correcting defects\nbefore the customer receives the product. These costs are incurred when the results\nof work fail to reach design quality standards. Examples include:\n▹Waste,  such as performance of unnecessary work or holding enough stock to account\nfor errors, poor organization, or communication;\n▹Scrap, such as defective product or material that cannot be repaired, used, or sold;\n▹Rework or rectification, such as correction of defective material or errors; and\n▹Failure analysis, such as activities required to establish the causes of internal product\nor service failure.\n▶External Failure.  External failure costs are associated with defects found after the\ncustomer has the product and with remediation. Note that to consider these failures\nholistically requires thinking about the project's product while it is in operation aftermonths or years, not just at the handover date. External failure costs occur when productsor services that fail to reach design quality standards are not detected until after they havereached the customer. Examples include:\n▹Repairs and servicing,  for both returned products and those that are deployed;\n▹Warranty claims, such as failed products that are replaced or services that arereperformed under a guarantee;\n▹Complaints,  for all work and costs associated with handling and servicing customers’\ncomplaints;\n▹Returns,  for handling and investigation of rejected or recalled products, including\ntransport costs; and\n▹Reputation,  where reputation and public perception can be damaged depending on the\ntype and severity of defects.\nTo optimize delivered value, early inspection and review work focused on finding quality issues as \nsoon as possible are good investments. Attempts to “test-quality-in” late in the development life cycle are likely to fail because discovering quality issues late in development is time- and cost-prohibitive due to high rates of scrap and rework, along with the ripple effect to downstream outputs and stakeholders.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202190\nPMBOK® Guide2.6.3.2  Cost of Change\nThe later a defect is found, the more expensive it is to correct. This is because design and \ndevelopment work have typically already occurred based on the flawed component. Also, activities \nare more costly to modify as the life cycle progresses since more stakeholders are impacted. This phenomenon is characterized by the cost of change curve (see Figure 2-22).\nCost\nPhase DetectedBuild Test Production Design RequirementsCost of Change\n1x5x20x50x150x\nBoehm’s  Cost of Change Curv e: Change ge ts more expensive over time\nFigure 2-22.

This approach can include quality analysts working with designers and engineers \nto understand and determine how best to achieve quality during each step in the project life cycle. Being proactive about quality work helps avoid the high cost of change associated with fixing quality issues discovered later in the life cycle. It is quicker and more cost efficient to fix a design problem between two engineers than a component problem affecting hundreds of units or to recall a product impacting thousands of customers.\n2.6.4  SUBOPTIMAL OUTCOMES\nAll projects attempt to deliver outcomes, though some may fail to do so or may produce \nsuboptimal outcomes. The potential for suboptimal outcomes exists in every project. In the case of a fully experimental project, the organization is attempting to achieve a breakthrough, such as the creation of a completely new technology, for example. This requires deliberate investment in an uncertain outcome. Companies that produce new medicines or compounds may experience several failures before finding a successful formula. Some projects may fail to deliver outcomes because the market opportunity has passed or competitors were first to market with their offering. Effective project management can minimize negative outcomes, but such possibilities are part of the uncertainty of attempting to produce a unique deliverable.\n2.6.5  INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nThe Delivery Performance Domain is the culmination of the work done in the Planning \nPerformance Domain. The delivery cadence is based on the way work is structured in the Development Approach and Life Cycle Performance Domain. The Project Work Performance Domain enables the deliveries by establishing processes, managing physical resources, managing procurements, and so forth. Project team members perform the work in this performance domain for the relevant stakeholders. The nature of the work to create the deliveries will influence how the project team navigates uncertainty that impacts the project.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202192\nPMBOK® Guide2.6.6  CHECKING RESULTS\nTable 2-8 identifies the outcomes on the left and ways of checking them on the right.\nTable 2-8.

In projects where requirements are evolving , a clear under-\nstanding of requirements may not take place until well into the project.\nInterviews, observation, and end user feedback indicate stakeholder \nsatisfaction with deliverables. Levels of complaints and returns can also be used to indicate satisfaction.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202193\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.7 MEASUREMENT PERFORMANCE DOMAIN\nMeasurement involves assessing project performance and implementing appropriate \nresponses to maintain optimal performance.MEASUREMENT PERFORMANCE DOMAIN\nA reliable understanding of the status of the project .\nActionable data to facilitate decision making .\nTimely and appropriate actions to ke ep project perfor mance \non track.\nAchie ving targets and ge nerating business va lue by making \ninformed and timely decisions based on reliable forecasts \nand evaluations.The Measurement \nPerformance Domain \naddresses activities and functions associated with assessing project perfor mance and taking \nappropriate actions to maintain acceptable performance.Effective  execution of this performance domain results in the \nfollowing desired outcomes:\nFigure 2-23. Measurement Performance Domain\nThe following definitions are relevant to the Measurement Performance Domain:\nMetric. A description of a project or product attribute and how to measure it.\nBaseline. The approved version of a work product used as a basis for comparison to actual results.Dashboard.  A set of charts and graphs showing progress or performance against important \nmeasures of the project. \nPMI Seventh Edition July 202194\nPMBOK® GuideThe Measurement Performance Domain evaluates the degree to which the work done in the \nDelivery Performance Domain is meeting the metrics identified in the Planning Performance Domain. \nFor example, performance can be measured and evaluated using baselines identified in the Planning Performance Domain. Having timely and accurate information about project work and performance allows the project team to learn and determine the appropriate action to take to address current or expected variances from the desired performance.\nMeasures are used for multiple reasons, including:\n▶Evaluating performance compared to plan;\n▶Tracking the utilization of resources, work completed, budget expended, etc.;\n▶Demonstrating accountability;\n▶Providing information to stakeholders;\n▶Assessing whether project deliverables are on track to deliver planned benefits;\n▶Focusing conversations about trade-offs, threats, opportunities, and options; and\n▶Ensuring the project deliverables will meet customer acceptance criteria.\nThe value of measurements is not in the collection and dissemination of the data, but rather \nin the conversations about how to use the data to take appropriate action. Therefore, while much of this performance domain addresses various types of measurements that can be captured, use of the measures occurs within the context of activities in other performance domains, such as project team and stakeholder discussions, coordinating project work, and so forth.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202195\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.7.1  ESTABLISHING",

Effective measures allow for tracking, evaluating, and reporting information that  \ncan communicate project status, help improve project performance, and reduce the likelihood  \nof performance deterioration. These measures allow the project team to use information to make \ntimely decisions and take effective actions.\n2.7.1.1  Key Performance Indicators\nKey performance indicators (KPIs) for projects are quantifiable measures used to evaluate the \nsuccess of a project. There are two types of KPIs: leading indicators and lagging indicators.\nThis performance domain focuses on measures for active projects. A portfolio leader may \nwant to include measures that address the success of the project after it is completed, such as whether the project delivered the intended outcomes and benefits. Portfolio leaders may assess if the project outcome increased customer satisfaction, decreased cost per unit, or other measures that are not available until after the project has closed. Similarly, business managers may assess the project from the perspective of the value the outcome brings to the organization. Business measures might include the increase in market share, increase in profit, or decrease in cost per unit. The Measurement Performance Domain addresses measures and metrics that are used during the project. \nPMI Seventh Edition July 202196\nPMBOK® Guide▶Leading indicators.  Leading indicators predict changes or trends in the project. If the\nchange or trend is unfavorable, the project team evaluates the root cause of the leading\nindicator measurement and takes actions to reverse the trend. Used in this way, leadingindicators can reduce performance risk on a project by identifying potential performancevariances before they cross the tolerance threshold.\nLeading indicators may be quantifiable, such as the size of the project or the number ofitems that are in progress in the backlog. Other leading indicators are more difficult toquantify, but they provide early warning signs of potential problems. The lack of a riskmanagement process, stakeholders who are not available or engaged, or poorly definedproject success criteria are all examples of leading indicators that project performancemay be at risk.\n▶Lagging indicators.  Lagging indicators measure project deliverables or events. They\nprovide information after the fact. Lagging indicators reflect past performance orconditions. Lagging indicators are easier to measure than leading indicators. Examplesinclude the number of deliverables completed, the schedule or cost variance, and theamount of resources consumed.\nLagging indicators can also be used to find correlations between outcomes and\nenvironmental variables. For example, a lagging indicator that shows a schedule variancemay show a correlation with project team member dissatisfaction. This correlation canassist the project team in addressing a root cause that may not have been obvious if theonly measure was schedule status.\nIn and of themselves, KPIs are simply measures that have no real use unless and until they \nare used. Discussing leading and lagging indicators and identifying areas for improvement, as appropriate, can have a positive impact on performance.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202197\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.7.1.2  Effective Metrics\nMeasuring takes time and effort, which could otherwise be spent on other productive work; \ntherefore, project teams should only measure what is relevant and should ensure that the metrics \nare useful. Characteristics of effective metrics (or SMART criteria) include:\n▶Specific.  Measurements are specific as to what to measure. Examples include the number\nof defects, the defects that have been fixed, or the average time it takes to fix defects.\n▶Meaningful. Measures should be tied to the business case, baselines, or requirements.\nIt is not efficient to measure product attributes or project performance that do not lead tomeeting objectives or improving performance.\n▶Achievable.  The target is achievable given the people, technology, and environment.\n▶Relevant. Measures should be relevant. The information provided by the measure shouldprovide value and allow for actionable information.\n▶Timely. Useful measurements are timely. Information that is old is not as useful as freshinformation. Forward-looking information, such as emerging trends, can help project teamschange direction and make better decisions.\nThe SMART acronym described previously can use alternative terms. For example, some people \nprefer “measurable” instead of meaningful,  “agreed to” instead of achievable,  “realistic” or \n“reasonable” instead of relevant,  and “time bound” instead of timely. \nPMI Seventh Edition July 202198\nPMBOK® Guide2.7.2  WHAT TO MEASURE\nWhat is measured, the parameters, and the measurement method depend on the project \nobjectives, the intended outcomes, and the environment in which the project takes place. Common \ncategories of metrics include:\n▶Deliverable metrics,\n▶Delivery,\n▶Baseline performance,\n▶Resources,\n▶Business value,\n▶Stakeholders, and\n▶Forecasts.\nA balanced set of metrics helps to provide a holistic picture of the project, its performance, and \nits outcomes.\nSections 2.7.2.1 through 2.7.2.7 provide a brief description of these categories.\n2.7.2.1  Deliverable Metrics\nBy necessity, the products, services, or results being delivered determine the useful measures. \nCustomary measures include:\n▶Information on errors or defects.

This measure includes the source of defects, number\nof defects identified, and number of defects resolved.\n▶Measures of performance.  Measures of performance characterize physical or functional\nattributes relating to the system operation. Examples include size, weight, capacity,accuracy, reliability, efficiency, and similar performance measures.\n▶Technical performance measures.  Quantifiable measures of technical performance are\nused to ensure system components meet technical requirements. They provide insightsinto progress in achieving the technical solution.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 202199\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.7.2.2  Delivery\nDelivery measurements are associated with work in progress. These measures are frequently \nused in projects using adaptive approaches.\n▶Work in progress.  This measure indicates the number of work items that are being worked\non at any given time. It is used to help the project team limit the number of items in progress\nto a manageable size.\n▶Lead time. This measure indicates the amount of elapsed time from a story or chunkof work entering the backlog to the end of the iteration or the release. Lower lead timeindicates a more effective process and a more productive project team.\n▶Cycle time. Related to lead time, cycle time indicates the amount of time it takes theproject team to complete a task. Shorter times indicate a more productive project team.\nA consistent time helps predict the possible rate of work in the future.\n▶Queue size. This measure tracks the number of items in a queue. This metric can becompared to the work in progress limit. Little’s Law states that queue size is proportionalto both the rate of arrival in the queue and the rate of completion of items from the queue.One can gain insights into completion times by measuring work in progress and developinga forecast for future work completion.\n▶Batch size. Batch size measures the estimated amount of work (level of effort, story points,etc.) that is expected to be completed in an iteration.\n▶Process efficiency.  Process efficiency is a ratio used in lean systems to optimize the flow\nof work. This measure calculates the ratio between value-adding time and non-value-addingactivities. Tasks that are waiting increase the non-value-adding time. Tasks that are indevelopment or in verification represent value-adding time. Higher ratios indicate a moreefficient process.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021100\nPMBOK® Guide2.7.2.3  Baseline Performance\nThe most common baselines are cost and schedule. Projects that track a scope or technical \nbaseline can use information in the deliverable measures.\nMost schedule measures track actual performance to planned performance related to:\n▶Start and finish dates. Comparing the actual start dates to the planned start dates and\nthe actual finish dates to the planned finish dates can measure the extent to which work isaccomplished as planned. Even if work is not on the longest path through the project (thecritical path), late start and finish dates indicate that the project is not performing to plan.\n▶Effort and duration.  Actual effort and duration compared to planned effort and duration\nindicates whether estimates for the amount of work and the time the work takes are valid.\n▶Schedule variance (SV).  A simple schedule variance is determined by looking at\nperformance on the critical path. When used with earned value management, it is thedifference between the earned value and the planned value. Figure 2-24 shows an earnedvalue graph illustrating the schedule variance.\n▶Schedule performance index (SPI).  Schedule performance index is an earned value\nmanagement measure that indicates how efficiently the scheduled work is being performed.\n▶Feature completion rates.  Examining the rate of feature acceptance during frequent\nreviews can help assess progress and estimate completion dates and costs.\nCommon cost measures include:\n▶Actual cost compared to planned cost.  This cost measure compares the actual cost for\nlabor or resources to the estimated cost. This term may be referred to as the burn rate.\n▶Cost variance (CV). A simple cost variance is determined by comparing the actual cost\nof a deliverable to the estimated cost. When used with earned value management, it isthe difference between the earned value and the actual cost. Figure 2-24 shows an earnedvalue graph illustrating the cost variance.\n▶Cost performance index (CPI).

Business value has many aspects—both financial \nand nonfinancial. Metrics that measure financial business value include:\n▶Cost-benefit ratio.  This is a measure of the expected present value of an investment with\nthe initial cost. The cost-benefit ratio is used to determine if the costs of a project outweigh \nits benefits. If the costs are greater than the benefits, the res\nult will be greater than 1.0. In this \ncase, the project should not be considered unless there are regulatory, social good, or otherreasons to do the project. A similar measure is a benefit-cost ratio. The same measures areused, but the benefits are in the numerator and the costs are in the denominator. For thismeasure, if the ratio is greater than 1.0, the project should be considered.\n▶Planned benefits delivery compared to actual benefits delivery.  As part of a business\ncase, organizations may identify value as the benefit that will be delivered as a result ofdoing the project. For projects that expect to deliver benefits during the project life cycle,measuring the benefits delivered and the value of those benefits, then comparing thatinformation to the business case, provides information that can justify the continuation\nof the project, or in some cases, the cancellation of the project.\n▶Return on investment (ROI).  A measure of the amount of financial return compared to \nthe cost, ROI is generally developed as an input to the decision to undertake a project. Theremay be estimates of ROI at different points in time across the project life cycle. By measuringROI throughout the project, the project team can determine if it makes sense to continue theinvestment of organizational resources.\n▶Net present value (NPV). The difference between the present value of inflows ofcapital and the present value of outflows of capital over a period of time, NPV is generallydeveloped when deciding to undertake a project. By measuring the NPV throughout theproject, the project team can determine if it makes sense to continue the investment oforganizational resources.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021103\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.7.2.6  Stakeholders\nStakeholder satisfaction can be measured with surveys or by inferring satisfaction, or lack \nthereof, and by looking at related metrics, such as:\n▶Net Promoter Score® (NPS®). A Net Promoter Score measures the degree to which a\nstakeholder (usually the customer) is willing to recommend a product or service to others.\nIt measures a range from -100 to +100. A high Net Promoter Score not only measuressatisfaction with a brand, product, or service, it is also an indicator of customer loyalty.\n▶Mood chart. A mood chart can track the mood or reactions of a group of very importantstakeholders—the project team. At the end of each day, project team members can usecolors, numbers, or emojis to indicate their frame of mind. Figure 2-25 shows a mood chartusing emojis. Tracking the project team’s mood or individual project team member’s moodscan help to identify potential issues and areas for improvement.\nSunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday\nFigure 2-25. Mood Board\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021104\nPMBOK® Guide▶Morale.  Since mood boards can be subjective, another option is to measure project team\nmorale. This can be done by surveys, asking project team members to rate their agreement\non a scale of 1 to 5 to statements such as:\n▹I feel my work contributes to the overall outcomes.\n▹I feel appreciated.\n▹I am satisfied with the way my project team works together.\n▶Turnover. Another way to track morale is by looking at unplanned project team turnover.High rates of unplanned turnover may indicate low morale.\n2.7.2.7  Forecasts\nProject teams use forecasts to consider what might happen in the future so they can consider \nand discuss whether to adapt plans and project work accordingly. Forecasts can be qualitative, such as using expert judgment about what the future will hold. They can also be causal when seeking to understand the impact a specific event or condition will have on future events. Quantitative forecasts seek to use past information to estimate what will happen in the future. Quantitative forecasts include:\n▶Estimate to complete (ETC).3 An earned value management measure that forecasts\nthe expected cost to finish all the remaining project work. There are many different waysto calculate the estimate to complete. Assuming past performance is indicative of futureperformance, a common measurement is calculation of the budget at completion minusthe earned value, then dividing by the cost performance index. For more calculations todetermine the ETC, see The Standard for Earned Value Management  [2].\n▶Estimate at completion (EAC). This earned value management measure forecasts theexpected total cost of completing all work (see Figure 2-26). There are many differentways to calculate the estimate at completion.

TCPI isexpressed as the ratio of the cost to finish the outstanding work to the remaining budget.\n▶Regression analysis.  An analytical method where a series of input variables are examined\nin relation to their corresponding output results in order to develop a mathematical orstatistical relationship. The relationship can be used to infer future performance.\n▶Throughput analysis. This analytical method assesses the number of items beingcompleted in a fixed time frame. Project teams that use adaptive practices use throughputmetrics such as features complete vs. features remaining, velocity, and story points toevaluate their progress and estimate likely completion dates.

For information to be useful, it has to be timely, accessible, easy to absorb and digest, \nand presented so that it correctly conveys the degree of uncertainty associated with the information. Visual displays with graphics can help stakeholders absorb and make sense of information.\n2.7.3.1  Dashboards\nA common way of showing large quantities of information on metrics is a dashboard. Dashboards \ngenerally collect information electronically and generate charts that depict status. Often, dashboards offer high-level summaries of data and allow drill-down analysis into contributing data. Figure 2-27 provides an example of a dashboard.\nDashboards often include information displayed as stoplight charts (also known as RAG charts \nwhere RAG is an abbreviation for red-amber-green), bar charts, pie charts, and control charts. A text explanation can be used for any measures that are outside the established thresholds.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021107\nSection 2 – Project Performance DomainsOrganization Project Name\nProject Name and\nHigh-LevelDescription\nExec Sponsor:\nStart Date:\nStatus:PM:\nEnd Date:\nSchedule\nActivity #1\nActivity #2\nActivity #3Concer n\nOn Track\nIssueResources\nRecent Accomplishments Upcoming Key Deliverables Status Key Activities\nCurrent Key Risks –C urrent Key Issues –BudgetReport  Period:\nThreats and oppor tunities;\nMitiga tionDescriptionOn TrackC omplete Concer n IssueO n Hold Canceled Not Star ted\nFigure 2-27.

Information Radiator\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021109\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.7.3.3  Visual Controls\nIn lean environments, information radiators are known as visual controls. Visual controls \nillustrate processes to easily compare actual against expected performance. Visual controls show a \nprocess using visual cues. Visual controls can be present for all levels of information from business value delivered to tasks that have started. They should be highly visible for anyone to see.\n▶Task boards.  A task board is a visual representation of the planned work that allows\neveryone to see the status of the tasks. A task board can show work that is ready to bestarted (to do), work in progress, and work that is completed (see Figure 2-29).\nA task board allows anyone to see at a glance the status of a particular task or the number\nof tasks in each stage of work. Different color sticky notes can represent different types ofwork, and dots can be used to show how many days a task has been in its current position.\nFlow-based projects, such as those that use kanban boards, can use these charts to limit\nthe amount of work in progress. If a column is approaching the work in progress limit,project team members can “swarm” around the current work to help those working ontasks that are slowing the flow.\n▶Burn charts. Burn charts, such as a burnup or burndown charts, can show project teamvelocity. Velocity measures the productivity rate at which the deliverables are produced,validated, and accepted within a predefined interval. A burnup chart can track the amountof work done compared to the expected work that should be done (see Figure 2-30).\nA burndown chart can show the number of story points remaining or the amount of riskexposure that has been reduced.\n▶Other types of charts. Visual charts can also include information such as an impedimentlist that shows a description of the impediment to getting work done, the severity, and theactions being taken to resolve the impediment.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021110\nPMBOK® GuideKanban Board\nReadyDevelop and\nUnit TestDev-DoneSystem\nTestDone\n8 3 2 Cycle time: from\nthe time yo u star t\na task until yo u\ncomplete it.\nLead time: from the time yo u \nput it on the board until yo u\ndeliver it.

Burnup Chart\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021112\nPMBOK® Guide▶Hawthorne effect.  The Hawthorne effect states that the very act of measuring something\ninfluences behavior. Therefore, take care in establishing metrics. For example, measuring\nonly a project team's output of deliverables can encourage the project team to focus oncreating a large volume of deliverables rather than focusing on deliverables that wouldprovide higher customer satisfaction.\n▶Vanity metric. A vanity metric is a measure that shows data but does not provide usefulinformation for making decisions. Measuring pageviews of a website is not as useful asmeasuring the number of new viewers.\n▶Demoralization.  If measures and goals are set that are not achievable, project team\nmorale may fall as they continuously fail to meet targets. Setting stretch goals andaspirational measures is acceptable, but people also want to see their hard workrecognized. Unrealistic or unachievable goals can be counterproductive.\n▶Misusing the metrics.  Regardless of the metrics used to measure performance, there\nis the opportunity for people to distort the measurements or focus on the wrong thing.Examples include:\n▹Focusing on less important metrics rather than the metrics that matter most,\n▹Focusing on performing well for the short-term measures at the expense of long-term\nmetrics, and\n▹Working on out-of-sequence activities that are easy to accomplish in order to improve\nperformance indicators.\n▶Confirmation bias.  As human beings, we tend to look for and see information that\nsupports our preexisting point of view. This can lead us to false interpretations of data.\n▶Correlation versus causation.  A common mistake in interpreting measurement data\nis confusing the correlation of two variables with the idea that one causes the other.For example",

A common mistake in interpreting measurement data\nis confusing the correlation of two variables with the idea that one causes the other.For example, seeing projects that are behind schedule and over budget might infer thatprojects that are over budget cause schedule issues. This is not true, nor is it true thatprojects that are behind schedule cause budget overruns. Instead, there are likely othercorrelating factors that are not being considered, such as skill in estimating, the ability\nto manage change, and actively managing risk.\nBeing aware of the pitfalls associated with metrics can help with establishing effective metrics \nin addition to being vigilant regarding the dangers associated with inappropriate measures.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021113\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.7.5  TROUBLESHOOTING PERFORMANCE\nPart of measurement is having agreed to plans for measures that are outside the threshold \nranges. Thresholds can be established for a variety of metrics such as schedule, budget, velocity, and \nother project-specific measures. The degree of variance will depend on stakeholder risk tolerances.\nFigure 2-31 shows an example of a budget threshold set at +10% (orange) and -20% (green) of \nthe predicted spend rate. The blue line is tracking the actual spend, and in January, it exceeded the +10% upper tolerance that would trigger the exception plan.\nIdeally, project teams should not wait until a threshold has been breached before taking action. \nIf a breach can be forecasted via a trend or new information, the project team can be proactive in addressing the expected variance.Planned and Actual Spend with T olerances\n$300,000\n$250,000$200,000$150,000$100,000\n$50,000\n$0\nJun        Jul        Aug        Sep        Oct        Nov       Dec        Jan        Feb        Mar        Apr       May  Planned\nUpper + 10%Lower – 20%Actuals\nFigure 2-31. Planned and Actual Spend Rates\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021114\nPMBOK® GuideAn exception plan is an agreed-upon set of actions to be taken if a threshold is crossed or \nforecast. Exception plans do not have to be formal; they can be as simple as calling a stakeholder \nmeeting to discuss the matter. The importance of the exception plan is to discuss the issue and develop a plan for what needs to be done. Then follow through to make sure the plan is implemented and determine if the plan is working.\n2.7.6  GROWING AND IMPROVING\nThe intent in measuring and displaying data is to learn and improve. To optimize project \nperformance and efficiency, only measure and report information that will:\n▶Allow the project team to learn,\n▶Facilitate a decision,\n▶Improve some aspect of the product or project performance,\n▶Help avoid an issue, and\n▶Prevent performance deterioration.\nApplied appropriately, measurements facilitate the project team’s ability to generate business \nvalue and achieve the project objectives and performance targets.\n2.7.7  INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nThe Measurement Performance Domain interacts with the Planning, Project Work, and \nDelivery Performance Domains as plans form the basis for comparing the deliveries to plan. The Measurement Performance Domain can support the activities that are part of the Planning Performance Domain by presenting up-to-date information so that lessons learned can reflect favorable or unfavorable information for updating plans. The Team and Stakeholder Performance Domains interact as project team members develop the plans and create the deliverables and deliveries that are measured.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021115\nSection 2 – Project Performance DomainsAs unpredictable events occur, both positive and negative, they have an impact on the project \nperformance and therefore on the project measurements and metrics. Responding to changes \ncaused by uncertain events that have occurred includes updating measurements that have been impacted due to the change. Activities in the Uncertainty Performance Domain, such as identifying risks and opportunities, can be initiated based on performance measurements.\nPart of the project work is working with the project team and other stakeholders to establish \nthe metrics, gather the data, analyze the data, make decisions, and report on project status.\n2.7.8  CHECKING RESULTS\nTable 2-9 identifies the outcomes from effective application of the Measurement Performance \nDomain on the left and ways of checking them on the right.\nTable 2-9.

Uncertainty Performance Domain\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021117\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains\nThe following definitions are relevant to the Uncertainty Performance Domain:\nUncertainty. A lack of understanding and awareness of issues, events, paths to follow, \nor solutions to pursue.\nAmbiguity.\n A state of being unclear, having difficulty in identifying the cause of events, or \nhaving multiple options from which to choose.Complexity.  A characteristic of a program or project or its environment that is difficult to \nmanage due to human behavior, system behavior, and ambiguity.Volatility.  The possibility for rapid and unpredictable change.\nRisk. An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one \nor more project objectives.\n \nUncertainty in the broadest sense is a state of not knowing or unpredictability. There are many \nnuances to uncertainty, such as:\n▶Risk associated with not knowing future events,\n▶Ambiguity associated with not being aware of current or future conditions, and\n▶Complexity associated with dynamic systems having unpredictable outcomes.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021118\nPMBOK® GuideSuccessfully navigating uncertainty begins with understanding the larger environment within \nwhich the project is operating. Aspects of the environment that contribute to project uncertainty \ninclude, but are not limited to:\n▶Economic factors such as volatility in prices, availability of resources, ability to borrow\nfunds, and inflation/deflation;\n▶Technical considerations such as new or emerging technology, complexity associated with\nsystems, and interfaces;\n▶Legal or legislative constraints or requirements;\n▶Physical environment as it pertains to safety, weather, and working conditions;\n▶Ambiguity associated with current or future conditions;\n▶Social and market influences shaped by opinion and media; and,\n▶Political influences, either external or internal to the organization.\nThis performance domain addresses the various aspects of uncertainty, implications of \nuncertainty, such as project risk, as well as options for navigating the various forms of uncertainty.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021119\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.8.1  GENERAL UNCERTAINTY\nUncertainty is inherent in all projects. For this reason, the effects of any activity cannot be \npredicted precisely, and a range of outcomes can occur. Potential outcomes that benefit the project \nobjectives are known as opportunities; potential outcomes that have a negative effect on objectives are called threats. Together, the set of opportunities and threats comprise the set of project risks. There are several options for responding to uncertainty:\n▶Gather information.  Sometimes uncertainty can be reduced by finding out more\ninformation, such as conducting research, engaging experts, or performing a marketanalysis. It is also important to recognize when further information collection and analysisexceed the benefit of having the additional information.\n▶Prepare for multiple outcomes.  In situations where there are only a few possible\noutcomes from an area of uncertainty, the project team can prepare for each of thoseoutcomes. This entails having a primary solution available, as well as having backup orcontingency plans in case the initial solution is not viable or effective. Where there is a largeset of potential outcomes, the project team can categorize and assess the potential causesto estimate their likelihood of occurrence. This allows the project team to identify the mostlikely potential outcomes on which to focus.\n▶Set-based design.  Multiple designs or alternatives can be investigated early in the project\nto reduce uncertainty. This allows the project team to look at trade-offs, such as time versuscost, quality versus cost, risk versus schedule, or schedule versus quality. The intention is toexplore options so the project team can learn from working with the various alternatives.Ineffective or suboptimal alternatives are discarded throughout the process.\n▶Build in resilience.  Resilience is the ability to adapt and respond quickly to unexpected\nchanges. Resilience applies to both project team members and organizational processes.\nIf the initial approach to product design or a prototype is not effective, the project team\nand the organization need to be able to learn, adapt, and respond quickly.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021120\nPMBOK® Guide2.8.2  AMBIGUITY\nThere are two categories of ambiguity: conceptual ambiguity and situational ambiguity. \nConceptual ambiguity—the lack of effective understanding—occurs when people use similar terms \nor arguments in different ways. For example, the statement, “The schedule was reported on track last",

For example, the statement, “The schedule was reported on track last week,” is not clear. It isn’t clear whether the schedule was on track last week or whether it was reported on last week. In addition, there could be some question as to what “on track” means. Ambiguity of this type can be reduced by formally establishing common rules and definitions of terms, such as what does “on track” mean.\nSituational ambiguity surfaces when more than one outcome is possible. Having multiple \noptions to solve a problem is a form of situational ambiguity. Solutions for exploration of ambiguity include progressive elaboration, experimentation, and the use of prototypes.\n▶Progressive elaboration.  This is the iterative process of increasing the level of detail\nin a project management plan as greater amounts of information and more accurateestimates become available.\n▶Experiments.  A well-designed series of experiments can help identify cause-and-effect\nrelationships or, at least, can reduce the amount of ambiguity.\n▶Prototypes.  Prototypes can help distinguish the relationships between different variables.\n2.8.3  COMPLEXITY\nComplexity is a characteristic of a program, project, or its environment, which is difficult to \nmanage due to human behavior, system behavior, or ambiguity. Complexity exists when there are many interconnected influences that behave and interact in diverse ways. In complex environments, it is not uncommon to see an aggregation of individual elements leading to unforeseen or unintended outcomes. The effect of complexity is that there is no way of making accurate predictions about the likelihood of any potential outcome or even of knowing what outcomes might emerge. There are numerous ways to work with complexity; some of them are systems-based, some entail reframing, and others are based on process.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021121\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.8.3.1  Systems-Based\nExamples of working with complexity that is systems based include:\n▶Decoupling.  Decoupling entails disconnecting parts of the system to both simplify the\nsystem and reduce the number of connected variables. Determining how a piece of a\nsystem works on its own reduces the overall size of the problem.\n▶Simulation.  There may be similar though unrelated scenarios that can be used to\nsimulate components of a system. A project to build a new airport that includes an areawith shopping and restaurants can learn about consumer buying habits by seeking outanalogous information on shopping malls and entertainment establishments.\n2.8.3.2  Reframing\nExamples of working with complexity that entail reframing are:\n▶Diversity.  Complex systems require viewing the system from diverse perspectives. This\ncan include brainstorming with the project team to open up divergent ways of seeing thesystem. It can also include Delphi-like processes to move from divergent to convergentthinking.\n▶Balance. Balancing the type of data used rather than only using forecasting data or datathat report on the past or lagging indicators provides a broader perspective. This caninclude using elements whose variations are likely to counteract each other's potentialnegative effects.\n2.8.3.3  Process-Based\nExamples of working with complexity that is process based include:\n▶Iterate.  Build iteratively or incrementally. Add features one at a time. After each\niteration, identify what worked, what did not work, customer reaction, and what the\nproject team learned.\n▶Engage. Build in opportunities to get stakeholder engagement. This reduces the number\nof assumptions and builds learning and engagement into the process.\n▶Fail safe.  For elements of a system that are critical, build in redundancy or elements that can\nprovide a graceful degradation of functionality in the event of a critical component failure.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021122\nPMBOK® Guide2.8.4  VOLATILITY\nVolatility exists in an environment that is subject to rapid and unpredictable change. Volatility \ncan occur when there are ongoing fluctuations in available skill sets or materials. Volatility usually \nimpacts cost and schedule. Alternatives analysis and use of cost or schedule reserve address volatility.\n▶Alternatives analysis.  Finding and evaluating alternatives, such as looking at different\nways to meet an objective, such as using a different mix of skills, resequencing work,or outsourcing work. Alternatives analysis may include identifying the variables to beconsidered in evaluating options, and the relative importance or weight of each variable.\n▶Reserve.  Cost reserve can be used to cover budget overruns due to price volatility. In some\ncircumstances, schedule reserve can be used to address delays due to volatility associatedwith resource availability.\nEffectively navigating uncertainty, ambiguity, complexity, and volatility improves the ability \nto anticipate situations, make good decisions, plan, and solve problems.\n2.8.5 RISK\nRisks are an aspect of uncertainty. A risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has \na positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives. Negative risks are called threats, and \npositive risks are called opportunities. All projects have risks since they are unique undertakings with \nvarying degrees of uncertainty.\nProject team members should proactively identify risks throughout the project to avoid or \nminimize the impacts of threats and trigger or maximize the impacts of opportunities. Both threats \nand opportunities have a set of possible response strategies that can be planned for implementation \nshould the risk occur.\nIn order to navigate risk effect ively, the project",

Both threats \nand opportunities have a set of possible response strategies that can be planned for implementation \nshould the risk occur.\nIn order to navigate risk effect ively, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure \nis acceptable in pursuit of the  project objectives. This is defined by measurable risk thresholds that \nreflect the risk appetite and at titude of the organization and pro ject stakeholders. Risk thresholds \nexpress the acceptable variation around an objective that reflects the risk appetite of the organization \nand stakeholders. Thresholds  are typically stated and communicated to the project team and reflected \nin the definitions of risk impact levels for the project.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021123\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.8.5.1  Threats\nA threat is an event or condition that, if it occurs, has a negative impact on one or more \nobjectives. Five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with threats, as follows:\n▶Avoid. Threat avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect\nthe project from its impact.\n▶Escalate.  Escalation is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees\nthat a threat is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response wouldexceed the project manager’s authority.\n▶Transfer.  Transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the\nrisk and to bear the impact if the threat occurs.\n▶Mitigate. In threat mitigation, action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or impact of a threat. Early mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair thedamage after the threat has occurred.\n▶Accept. Threat acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat, but no proactive\naction is planned. Actively accepting a risk can include developing a contingency plan thatwould be triggered if the event occurred; or it can include passive acceptance, which meansdoing nothing.\nOverall Project Risk\nOverall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty. This includes individual risks and the exposure to the implications of variation in project outcome, both positive and negative. Overall risk is often a function of complexity, ambiguity, and volatility. Responses to overall project risk are the same as for individual threats and opportunities, though responses are applied to the overall project rather than to a specific event.  \nIf the overall risk on the project is too high, the organization may choose to cancel the project. \nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021124\nPMBOK® GuideA response to a specific threat might include multiple strategies. For example, if the threat \ncannot be avoided, it may be mitigated to a level at which it becomes viable to transfer or to accept it.\nThe goal of implementing threat responses is to reduce the amount of negative risk. Risks that \nare accepted sometimes are reduced simply by the passage of time or because the risk event does \nnot occur. Figure 2-33 shows how risks are tracked and reduced over time.\nThreat ProfileCumulative Risk30\n25201510\n50\nJan Feb Mar AprPermits obtained\nSite not ready in time\nEarly road thawProduction reser ve\nPump capacityJan \nShort Risk NameIDFebM ar Apr\n0\n0029000133232300249001233222360366201323232394643322213232312345Permits obtained\nSite not ready in timeEarly road tha w\nProduction reser ve\nPump capacityProbability Impact Severity Probability Impact Severity Probability Impact Severity Probability Impact Severity\nFigure 2-33. Risk Reduction over Time\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021125\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.8.5.2  Opportunities\nAn opportunity is an event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive impact on one or more \nproject objectives. An example of an opportunity could be a time and materials-based subcontractor \nwho finishes work early, resulting in lower costs and schedule savings.\nFive alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with opportunities, as follows:\n▶Exploit. A response strategy whereby the project team acts to ensure that an opportunityoccurs.\n▶Escalate.  As with threats, this opportunity response strategy is used when the project team\nor the project sponsor agrees that an opportunity is outside the scope of the project or thatthe proposed response would exceed the project manager’s authority.\n▶Share.  Opportunity sharing involves allocating ownership of an opportunity to a third party\nwho is best able to capture the benefit of that opportunity.\n▶Enhance. In opportunity enhancement, the project team acts to increase the probability\nof occurrence or impact of an opportunity. Early enhancement action is often moreeffective than trying to improve the opportunity after it has occurred.\n▶Accept. As with threats, accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but noproactive action is planned.\nOnce a set of risk responses has been developed, it should be reviewed to see whether the \nplanned responses have added any secondary risks. The review should also assess the residual risk that will remain once the response actions have been carried out. Response planning should be repeated until residual risk is compatible with the organization's risk appetite.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021126\nPMBOK® Guide\nTaking an economic view of work prioritization allows the team to prioritize threat avoidance \nand reduction activities.\nComparing the expected monetary value (EMV) of a risk to the anticipated return on investment \n(ROI) of a deliverable or feature allows the project manager to have conversations with sponsors or product owners about where and when to incorporate risks responses",

Contingency \nreserve is set aside to address identified risks should they occur. Management reserve is a budget \ncategory used for unknown events such as unplanned, in-scope work.\n2.8.5.4 Risk Review\nEstablishing a frequent rhythm or cadence of review and feedback sessions from a broad \nselection of stakeholders is helpful for navigating project risk and being proactive with risk responses.\nDaily standup meetings can be used in any project and are a source for identifying potential \nthreats and opportunities. Reports of blockers or impediments could become threats if they continue to delay progress. Likewise, reports of progress and breakthroughs might point toward opportunities to be further leveraged and shared.\nFrequent demonstrations of increments of the product or service, interim designs, or proof \nof concepts can surface threats and opportunities. Negative feedback from demonstrations or design reviews can be an early indicator of threats related to dissatisfaction from stakeholders if not corrected. Positive feedback helps inform the project team regarding the areas of development highly valued by the business representatives.\nAddressing risk at weekly status meetings ensures that risk management remains relevant. \nThese meetings can be used to identify new risks as well as identify changes to existing risks.\nRetrospectives and lessons learned meetings can be used to identify threats to performance, \nproject team cohesion, etc., and to seek improvements. They can also help identify practices to try different ways to exploit and enhance opportunities.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021128\nPMBOK® Guide2.8.6  INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nThe Uncertainty Performance Domain interacts with the Planning, Project Work, Delivery, and \nMeasurement Performance Domains from the product or deliverable perspective. As planning is \nconducted, activities to reduce uncertainty and risks can be built into the plans. These are carried out in the Delivery Performance Domain. Measurements can indicate if the risk level is changing over time.\nProject team members and other stakeholders are the main sources of information regarding \nuncertainty. They can provide information, suggestions, and assistance in working with all the various forms of uncertainty.\nThe choice of life cycle and development approach impact how uncertainty will be addressed. \nOn a predictive project where the scope is relatively stable, reserve in the schedule and budget can be used to respond to risks. On a project using an adaptive approach where the requirements are likely to evolve and where there may be ambiguity around how systems will interact or how stakeholders will react, the project team can adjust plans to reflect evolving understanding or use reserves to offset the impacts of realized risks.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021129\nSection 2 – Project Performance Domains2.8.7  CHECKING RESULTS\nTable 2-10 identifies the outcomes on the left and ways of checking them on the right.\nTable 2-10.

In both of these e xamples, the organizations \nare aligned with the principle o f “Optimize risk responses” even t hough their appetite, processes, and \nprocedures are different.\nTailoring entails the mindful selection and adjustment of multiple project factors, regardless \nof whether the label of “tailoring” is used.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021132\nPMBOK® GuideTailoring involves understanding the project context, goals, and operating environment. Projects \noperate in complex environments that need to balance potentially competing demands that include, \nbut are not limited to:\n▶Delivering as quickly as possible,\n▶Minimizing project costs,\n▶Optimizing the value delivered,\n▶Creating high-quality deliverables and outcomes,\n▶Providing compliance with regulatory standards,\n▶Satisfying diverse stakeholder expectations, and\n▶Adapting to change.\nThe alternative to tailoring is using an unmodified framework or methodology. There are many \nmethodologies available that provide descriptions of processes, phases, methods, artifacts, and templates to be used in projects. These methodologies and their components are not customized to the organizational context.\nMost of these methodologies have clear instructions stating they should not be applied rigorously \nbut should be subject to a process of tailoring to determine which elements are most useful given the particular type, size, and complexity of the project. Some inexperienced practitioners try to apply the methodology verbatim without regard to project size, complexity, duration, or organizational context. \nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021133\nSection 3 – TailoringThese factors need to be understood, evaluated, and balanced to create a practical operating \nenvironment for the project.\nThere may be situations that limit the degree to which project teams can tailor their approach, \nfor example, when organizational policies mandate the use of a specific approach or a contract \nspecifies a mandated approach.\n3.2 WHY TAILOR?\nTailoring is performed to better suit the organization, operating environment, and project needs. \nMany variables factor into the tailoring process, including the criticality of the project and the number of stakeholders involved. Using these variables as an example, it is evident that the rigor, checks and balances, and reporting required for a critical project (e.g., building a nuclear reactor) are much greater than those for building a new office building.\nLikewise, the communication and coordination of work necessary for a project team of  \n10 people is insufficient for a project team of 200 people. Too few processes can omit key activities that support effective project management, while employing more processes than required is costly and wasteful. Thus, tailoring facilitates appropriate management for the operating environment and the project needs.\nThe structure used to deliver projects can be extensive or minimal, rigorous or lightweight, \nrobust or simple. There is no single approach that can be applied to all projects all of the time. Instead, tailoring should reflect the size, duration, and complexity of each individual project and should be adapted to the industry, organizational culture, and level of project management maturity of the organization.\nTailoring produces direct and indirect benefits to organizations. These include, but are not \nlimited to:\n▶More commitment from project team members who helped to tailor the approach,\n▶Customer-oriented focus, as the needs of the customer are an important influencing factor\nin its development, and\n▶More efficient use of project resources.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021134\nPMBOK® Guide3.3 WHAT TO TAILOR\nProject aspects that can be tailored include:\n▶Life cycle and development approach selection,\n▶Processes,\n▶Engagement,\n▶Tools, and\n▶Methods and artifacts.\nSections 3.3.1 through 3.3.4 explore each of these in more detail.\n3.3.1  LIFE CYCLE AND DEVELOPMENT APPROACH SELECTION\nDeciding on a life cycle and the phases of the life cycle is an example of tailoring. Additional \ntailoring can be done when selecting the development and delivery approach for the project. Some \nlarge projects may use a combination of development and delivery approaches simultaneously. For instance, building a new data center could involve (a) the use of predictive approaches for the physical building construction and finishing and (b) an iterative approach for understanding and establishing the computing capabilities required. Viewed from a project level, this combination of approaches represents a hybrid approach, but the construction team and the computing team may only experience a predictive or iterative development approach.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021135\nSection 3 – Tailoring3.3.2  PROCESSES\nProcess tailoring for the selected life cycle and development approach includes determining \nwhich portions or elements should be:\n▶Added,  to bring required rigor, coverage, or address unique product or operating environment\nconditions, etc. (e.g., adding independent inspections for safety-critical projects);\n▶Modified, to better suit the project or project team requirements (e.g., modifying\nthe format of project documents to accommodate project team members with\nvision limitations);\n▶Removed,  to reduce cost or effort since it is no longer required or is not economical\nfor the value it adds (e.g., removing the creation of meeting minutes for a small, colocated\nproject team with good communications",

This entails evaluating the skills and capabilities of the project leadership and the\nproject team; then selecting who should be involved and in what capacities based on the\nproject type and operating conditions. For example, on a challenging or time-constrainedproject, assigning very experienced project team members is more logical than usinginexperienced project team members.\n▶Empowerment.  Empowerment involves choosing which responsibilities and forms of\nlocal decision making should be deferred to the project team. Some environments andteam member capabilities support high levels of empowerment. In other situations, lessempowerment with more supervision and direction might be preferable.\n▶Integration.  Project teams can include contributors from contracted entities, channel\npartners, and other external entities in addition to staff from inside the sponsoringorganization. Tailoring considers how to create one project team from a diverse\ncollection of contributors to facilitate optimal project team performance and realization\nof project outcomes.\n3.3.4 TOOLS\nSelecting the tools (e.g., software or equipment) the project team will use for the project  \nis a form of tailoring. Often, the project team has the best insight into the most suitable tools for \nthe situation, but those choices might need tempering based on the associated costs. Additionally, \norganizational leaders can impose constraints that the project team cannot change.\n3.3.5  METHODS AND ARTIFACTS\nTailoring the means that will be used to achieve the project outcomes is performed so that the \nmethods are suited for the environment and the culture. Tailoring the documents, templates, and \nother artifacts that will be used on the project helps to make sure the artifacts are appropriate for the \nproject and the organization. Section 4 contains numerous examples of methods and artifacts that \ncan be considered when tailoring methods and artifacts.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021137\nSection 3 – Tailoring3.4 THE TAILORING PROCESS\nAs noted in Section 2.5 of The Standard for Project Management  [1], projects exist in environments \nthat may have an influence on them. Prior to tailoring, the project environment needs to be analyzed \nand understood. Tailoring typically begins by selecting a development and delivery approach, tailoring it for the organization, tailoring it for the project, and then implementing its ongoing improvement. These steps in the process are shown in Figure 3-1 and described in more detail in Sections 3.4.1 through 3.4.4 of this guide.\nChoose a\ndevelopment\napproach best\nsuited for\nthe endea vorModify based on\norganizational\nmodificationsAdjust based on\nsize, criticality ,\nand other factor sInspect\nand adapt\n1) Select Initial\nDevelopment\nApproach2) Tailor for\nOrganization\n3) Tailor for\nProject4) Implement\nOng\noing\nImprovement\nFigure 3-1. Details of the Steps in the Tailoring Process\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021138\nPMBOK® Guide3.4.1  SELECT INITIAL DEVELOPMENT APPROACH\nThis step determines the development approach that will be used for the project. Project teams \napply their knowledge of the product, delivery cadence, and awareness of the available options to \nselect the most appropriate development approach for the situation. Selecting the initial approach is depicted in Figure 3-2.\nA suitability filter tool helps project teams consider whether a project has characteristics \nthat lend themselves toward a predictive, hybrid, or adaptive approach. The suitability filter is an informational tool that combines its assessment with other data and decision-making activities so that the tailored approach is appropriate for each project. By evaluating criteria based on culture, project team, and project factors, a suitability filter generates a diagnostic visual that can be helpful in discussing and deciding on the initial approach.Figure 3-2. Selecting the Initial Development Approach\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021139\nSection 3 – Tailoring3.4.2  TAILOR FOR THE ORGANIZATION\nWhile project teams own and improve their processes, organizations often require some level \nof approval and oversight. Many organizations have a project methodology, general management \napproach, or general development approach that is used as a starting point for their projects. These guides are intended to support such things as repeatable processes, consistent measures of the organization’s project capabilities, and continuous improvement of those capabilities. Organizations that have established process governance need to ensure tailoring is aligned to policy. To demonstrate that the project team’s tailoring decisions do not threaten the organization’s larger strategic or stewardship goals, project teams",

Many organizations have a project methodology, general management \napproach, or general development approach that is used as a starting point for their projects. These guides are intended to support such things as repeatable processes, consistent measures of the organization’s project capabilities, and continuous improvement of those capabilities. Organizations that have established process governance need to ensure tailoring is aligned to policy. To demonstrate that the project team’s tailoring decisions do not threaten the organization’s larger strategic or stewardship goals, project teams may need to justify using a tailored approach.\nAdditional constraints for tailoring for the organization include large, safety-critical projects and \nprojects performed under contract. Large, safety-critical project tailoring suggestions may require additional oversight and approval to help prevent errors, loss, or subsequent issues. Projects that are performed under contract may have contract terms that specify the use of a particular life cycle, delivery approach, or methodology.\nThe tailoring process shown in Figure 3-3 uses factors such as project size, criticality, \norganizational maturity, and other considerations.\nFigure 3-3. Tailoring the Approach for the Organization\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021140\nPMBOK® GuideTailoring for the organization involves adding, removing, and reconfiguring elements of the \napproach to make it more suitable for the individual organization. This process is shown in Figure 3-4.\nOrganizations with a project management office (PMO) or value delivery office (VDO) may play \na role in reviewing and approving tailored delivery approaches.\nTailoring that only impacts the project team (e.g., when they hold internal meetings, who works \nwhere, etc.) requires less oversight than tailoring that impacts external groups (e.g., how and when \nother departments are engaged, etc.). Therefore, internal project tailoring might be approved by the project manager while tailoring changes that impact external groups may require approval by the PMO or VDO. The PMO or VDO can assist project teams as they tailor their approaches by providing ideas and solutions from other project teams.Tailoring at the\nOrganizational\nLevel\nTailoring at the\nProject LevelA General\nProject\nManagement\nMethodologyA General\nDevelopment\nApproach\nOrganization’s\nMethodology for\nSmall ProjectsOrganization’s\nMethodology for\nLarge/Sensitive\nProjects\nMethodology for\nProject AMethodology for\nProject BMethodology for\nProject CMethodology for\nProject DMethodology for\nProject EModels,\nMethods,\nand\nArtifactsGeneral\nGuidesEnvironmental\nFactors\nFigure 3-4. Assessing the Organizational and Project Factors When Tailoring\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021141\nSection 3 – Tailoring3.4.3  TAILOR FOR THE PROJECT\nMany attributes influence tailoring for the project. These include, but are not limited to:\n▶Product/deliverable,\n▶Project team, and\n▶Culture.\nThe project team should ask questions about each attribute to help guide them in the tailoring \nprocess. Answers to these questions can help identify the need to tailor processes, delivery approach, \nlife cycle, tools, methods, and artifacts.\nA VDO may be found in organizations that use more adaptive delivery approaches. The VDO \nserves an enabling role, rather than a management or oversight function. It focuses on coaching project teams; building adaptive skills and capabilities throughout the organization; and mentoring sponsors and product owners to be more effective in those roles.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021142\nPMBOK® Guide3.4.3.1  Product/Deliverable\nAttributes associated with the product or deliverable include, but are not limited to:\n▶Compliance/criticality.  How much process rigor and quality assurance is appropriate?\n▶Type of product/deliverable.  Is the product well known and physical, for example,\nsomething easy to recognize and describe like a building? Or something intangible like\nsoftware or the design of a new drug?\n▶Industry market.  What market does the project, product, or deliverable serve? Is that market\nhighly regulated, fast moving, or slow to evolve? What about competitors and incumbents?\n▶Technology. Is the technology stable and well established or rapidly evolving and at risk\nof obsolescence?\n▶Time frame. Is the project time frame short as in weeks or months, or long as in\nseveral years?\n▶Stability of requirements.  How likely are there to be changes to core requirements?\n▶Security.  Are elements of the product business confidential or classified?\n▶Incremental delivery.  Is this something the project team can develop and get stakeholder\nfeedback on incrementally, or something that is hard to evaluate until near completion?\n3.4.3.2  Project Team\nProject team considerations include:\n▶Project team size.  How many full-time and part-time people will be working on the project?\n▶Project team geography.  Where are the team members predominantly located\ngeographically? Will some or all of the team be remote or colocated?\n▶Organizational distribution.  Where are the team’s supporting groups and other\nstakeholders located?\n▶Project team experience.  Do the project team members have any experience in the\nindustry, in the organization, or working with each other? Do they have the skills, tools,\nand technology required for the project under consideration?\n▶Access to customer.  Is it practical to get frequent and timely feedback from customers\nor customer representatives?\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021143\nSection 3 – Tailoring3.4.3.3  Culture\nEvaluating the culture includes considerations regarding:\n▶Buy-in.

Do the organizational values and culture align with the project\napproach? This includes empowering versus specifying and checking, trusting local decisionmaking versus requesting external decision making, etc.\nThrough the evaluation of these attributes, tailoring decisions around engagement, process, \nand tools can be made for the project. These removals and additions are depicted in Figure 3-5 with an “X” for removals and dotted boxes for the addition of trial processes\nFigure 3-5. Tailoring the Approach for the Project\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021144\nPMBOK® Guide3.4.3.4  Implement Ongoing Improvement\nThe process of tailoring is not a single, one-time exercise. During progressive elaboration, \nissues with how the project team is working, how the product or deliverable is evolving, and other \nlearnings will indicate where further tailoring could bring improvements. Review points, phase gates, and retrospectives all provide opportunities to inspect and adapt the process, development approach, and delivery frequency as necessary.\nKeeping the project team engaged with improving its process can foster pride of ownership and \ndemonstrate a commitment to implement ongoing improvements and quality. Engaging the project team to find and implement improvements also demonstrates trust in their skills and suggestions along with empowerment. Project team engagement with tailoring demonstrates a mindset of innovation and improvement rather than settling for the status quo.\nThe concept of adding, removing, and changing processes is shown in Figure 3-6.\nHow organizations tailor can itself be tailored. However, most organizations undertake some \nor all of the four steps described. They use elements of selecting an initial approach, tailoring for the \norganization, tailoring for the project, and implementing ongoing improvement as shown in Figure 3-7.Figure 3-6. Implement Ongoing Improvement\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021145\nSection 3 – Tailoring3.5 TAILORING THE PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nThe work associated with each performance domain can also be tailored, based on the \nuniqueness of the project.

It involves the analysis, \ndesign, and deliberate modification of the people elements, the processes employed, and the tools used. The tailoring process involves four steps:\n▶Select initial approach.\n▶Tailor for the organization.\n▶Tailor for the project.\n▶Implement ongoing improvement.\nWhile the tailoring process is often undertaken by the project stakeholders, the bounds and \napproach to tailoring are usually governed by organizational guidelines. Organizational governance helps ensure the external interfaces between project teams mesh correctly and provides guidance  \nin the form of tailoring considerations.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021153Models, Methods, \nand Artifacts\n4.1 OVERVIEW\nThis section provides a high-level description of some commonly used models, methods, and \nartifacts that are useful in managing projects. The items listed in this section are not intended to be \nexhaustive or prescriptive, but rather to help project teams think about the options available to them.\nIn the context of this guide, terms are defined as follows:\n▶Model. A model is a thinking strategy to explain a process, framework, or phenomenon.\n▶Method. A method is the means for achieving an outcome, output, result, or projectdeliverable.\n▶Artifact.  An artifact can be a template, document, output, or project deliverable.\nAs project teams consider the tailoring questions in Section 3.5 and decide on specific responses \nto those questions, they will start to build a framework for structuring their efforts to deliver the project outcomes. For example, project teams select specific methods to enable capturing and sharing the applicable information so they can track progress, improve project team performance in real time, and engage stakeholders.\nFigure 4-1 shows how tailoring includes the models and methods used to perform work in \nthe project performance domains.

As much as possible, project teams should avoid using anything that:\n▶Duplicates or adds unnecessary effort,\n▶Is not useful to the project team and its stakeholders,\n▶Produces incorrect or misleading information, or\n▶Caters to individual needs versus those of the project team.\n4.2 COMMONLY USED MODELS\nModels reflect small-scale, simplified views of reality and present scenarios, strategies, or \napproaches for optimizing work processes and efforts. A model helps to explain how something works in the real world. Models can shape behavior and point to approaches for solving problems or meeting needs. Some models were developed with projects and project teams in mind, others are more general in nature. Where feasible, models in this section are presented as they apply to projects. The content in this section does not describe how to develop or create new models.\nThe model descriptions presented provide a high-level view. Project team members and \nother stakeholders can refer to many sources (e.g., PMI’s library of standards products and PMIstandards+™) for more-complete descriptions and explanations of the models.\n4.2.1  SITUATIONAL LEADERSHIP MODELS\nSituational leadership models are a subset of a vast array of leadership models. Just as \nproject teams tailor the processes, methods, life cycles, and development approaches, leadership styles are also tailored.

Just as \nproject teams tailor the processes, methods, life cycles, and development approaches, leadership styles are also tailored. Situational leadership models describe ways to tailor one’s leadership style to meet the needs of the individual and the project team. The following are examples of two situational leadership models.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021156\nPMBOK® Guide4.2.1.1  Situational Leadership® II\nKen Blanchard’s Situational Leadership® II measures project team member development using \ncompetence and commitment as the two main variables. Competence is the combination of ability, \nknowledge, and skill. Commitment speaks to the confidence and motivation an individual has. As an individual’s competence and commitment evolve, leadership styles evolve from directing to coaching to supporting to delegating in order to meet the individual’s needs.\n4.2.1.2  OSCAR Model\nThe OSCAR coaching and mentoring model was developed by Karen Whittleworth and Andrew \nGilbert. It helps individuals adapt their coaching or leadership styles to support individuals who have an action plan for personal development. The model refers to five contributing factors:\n▶Outcome. An outcome identifies the long-term goals of an individual and the desired\nresult from each conversation session.\n▶Situation.  A situation enables conversation about the current skills, abilities, and\nknowledge level of the project team member; why the person is at that level; and howthat level impacts the individual’s performance and peer relationships.\n▶Choices/consequences.  Choice and/or consequences identify all the potential avenues\nfor attaining the desired outcome and the consequences of each choice so an individualcan choose viable avenues for reaching their long-term goals.\n▶Actions.  An action commits to specific improvements by focusing on immediate and\nattainable targets that an individual can work toward within a specified time frame.\n▶Review. Holding regular meetings offers support and helps to ensure that individualsremain motivated and on track.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021157\nSection 4 – Models, Methods, and Artifacts4.2.2  COMMUNICATION MODELS\nProject success is dependent on effective communication. Communication models \ndemonstrate concepts associated with how sender and receiver frames of reference impact the \neffectiveness of communication, how the communication medium influences the effectiveness of communication, and the types of disconnects between end-user expectations and reality. With the prevalence of multicultural project teams and dispersed stakeholders, these models provide a way of viewing communication styles and methods to enhance communication efficiency and effectiveness. There are many communication models that demonstrate different aspects of communication. Sections 4.2.2.1 through 4.2.2.3 provide a sampling of communication models.\n4.2.2.1  Cross-Cultural Communication\nA communication model developed by Browaeys and Price incorporates the idea that the \nmessage itself and how it is transmitted is influenced by the sender’s current knowledge, experience, language, thinking, and communication styles, as well as stereotypes and relationship to the receiver. Similarly, the receiver’s knowledge, experience, language, thinking, and communication styles, as well as stereotypes and relationship to the sender will influence how the message is interpreted.\n4.2.2.2  Effectiveness of Communication Channels\nAlistair Cockburn developed a model that describes the communication channels along the \naxes of effectiveness and richness. As defined by Richard Daft and Robert Lengel, richness relates to the amount of learning that can be transmitted through a medium. Media richness is a function of characteristics, including the ability to:\n▶Handle multiple information cues simultaneously,\n▶Facilitate rapid feedback,\n▶Establish a personal focus, and\n▶Utilize natural language.\nRichness in communication allows a broad spectrum of information to be conveyed rapidly. \nSituations that entail complex, complicated, and personal information benefit from richer communication channels, such as face-to-face communication. Situations that impart simple,  \nfactual information can use less rich communication channels such as a note or a text message.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021158\nPMBOK® Guide4.2.2.3 Gulf of Execution and Evaluation\nDonald Norman described the gulf of execution as the degree to which an item corresponds \nwith what a person expects it to do. Said another way, it is the di fference between the intention of \na user and what the item allows them to do or supports them in doing. A car that has the ability to \nparallel park itself would have a gulf of execution if the driver expected to push a button labeled \n“park” and have the car park itself, and the car did not park itself.\nThe gulf of evaluation is the  degree to which an item supports the user in discovering how to \ninterpret the item and interact with it effectively. The same parking example would show a gulf o f \nevaluation if the controls were  not designed in such a way that  the driver could easily determine how \nto initiate the self-parking function.\n4.2.3  MOTIVATION MODELS\nPeople perform better when they are motivated, and people are motivated by di fferent things. \nUnderstanding what motivates project team members and other stakeholders helps to tailor rewards \nto the individual, thereby eliciting more effective engagement. There are a significant number of \nmodels that illustrate how people are motivated. Four models are described in Sections 4.2.3.1 \nthrough 4.2.3.4, though these are a small representation of available models.\n4.2.3.1 Hygiene and Motivational Factors\nFrederick Herzberg conducted a study of motivational factors in working life.

He believed that \njob satisfaction and dissatisfaction stem from conditions called motivational factors. Motivational \nfactors include matters that relate to the content of the work, such as achievement, growth, and \nadvancement. Insufficient motivational factors lead to dissatisfaction. Sufficient motivational factors \nlead to satisfaction.\nHerzberg also identified hygiene factors related to the work, such as company policies, salary, \nand the physical environment. If hygiene factors are insufficient, they cause dissatisfaction. However, \neven if they are sufficient, they do not lead to satisfaction.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021159\nSection 4 – Models, Methods, and Artifacts4.2.3.2  Intrinsic versus Extrinsic Motivation\nDaniel Pink published several books about the intrinsic factors that motivate people. He stated \nthat while extrinsic rewards, such as salary, are motivators to a certain extent, once a person is paid \nfairly for their work, the motivational power of extrinsic rewards ceases to exist. For complicated and challenging work, such as much of the work on projects, intrinsic motivators are far longer lasting and more effective. Pink identifies three types of intrinsic motivators: autonomy, mastery, and purpose:\n▶Autonomy.  Autonomy is the desire to direct one’s own life. This is aligned with being able\nto determine how, where, and when to accomplish work. Autonomy includes flexible workhours, working from home, and work on self-selecting and self-managing project teams.\n▶Mastery. Mastery is about being able to improve and excel. The desire to do excellentwork, learn, and achieve goals are aspects of mastery.\n▶Purpose. Purpose speaks to the need to make a difference. Knowing the project vision\nand how work contributes to achieving that vision allows people to feel like they are makinga difference.\n4.2.3.3  Theory of Needs\nDavid McClellan’s model states that all people are driven by needs of achievement, power, and \naffiliation. The relative strength of each need depends on an individual’s experiences and culture.\n▶Achievement. People who are motivated by achievement, such as reaching a goal,\nare motivated by activities and work that is challenging, but reasonable.\n▶Power.  People who are motivated by power like to organize, motivate, and lead others.\nThey are motivated by increased responsibility.\n▶Affiliation.  People who are motivated by affiliation seek acceptance and belonging.\nThey are motivated by being part of a team.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021160\nPMBOK® Guide4.2.3.4  Theory X, Theory Y , and Theory Z\nDouglas McGregor devised the Theory X and Theory Y models, which represent a spectrum \nof employee motivation and corresponding management styles. This was later expanded to \ninclude Theory Z.\n▶Theory X. The X side of the spectrum assumes individuals work for the sole purpose ofincome. They are not ambitious or goal oriented. The corresponding management style tomotivate these individuals is a hands-on and top-down approach. This management styleis often seen in a production or labor-intensive environment, or one with many layers ofmanagement.\n▶Theory Y. The Y side of the spectrum assumes that individuals are intrinsically motivatedto do good work. The corresponding management style has a more personal coaching feel.The manager encourages creativity and discussion. This management style is often seen increative and knowledge worker environments.\n▶Theory Z. Abraham Maslow saw Theory Z as a transcendent dimension to work whereindividuals are motivated by self-realization, values, and a higher calling. The optimalmanagement style in this situation is one that cultivates insight and meaning.\nWilliam Ouchi’s version of Theory Z focuses on motivating employees by creating a job\nfor life where the focus is on the well-being of employees and their families. This style ofmanagement seeks to promote high productivity, morale, and satisfaction.\n4.2.4  CHANGE MODELS\nMany projects contain an aspect of changing systems, behaviors, activities, and sometimes, \ncultures. Managing this type of change requires thinking about how to transition from the current to the future desired state. There are many models that describe the activities necessary for successful change management. Sections 4.2.4.1 through 4.2.4.5 provide a sampling of the change models.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021161\nSection 4 – Models, Methods, and Artifacts4.2.4.1  Managing Change in Organizations\nManaging Change in Organizations: A Practice Guide [3] is an iterative model that is based \non common elements across a range of change management models. The framework has five \nassociated elements interconnected through a series of feedback loops:\n▶Formulate change.  This element focuses on building the rationale to help people\nunderstand why change is needed and how the future state will be better.\n▶Plan change. The identification of activities helps people prepare for the transition fromthe current to the future state.\n▶Implement change.  This iterative element focuses on demonstrating the future state\ncapabilities, checking to ensure the capabilities are having the intended impact, and makingnecessary improvements or adaptations in response.\n▶Manage transition.  This element considers how to address needs related to the change\nthat may surface once the future state is achieved.\n▶Sustain change. This element seeks to ensure that the new capabilities continue andprevious processes or behaviors cease.\n4.2.4.2  ADKAR® Model\nJeff Hiatt developed the",

This element seeks to ensure that the new capabilities continue andprevious processes or behaviors cease.\n4.2.4.2  ADKAR® Model\nJeff Hiatt developed the ADKAR® Model which focuses on five sequential steps that individuals \nundergo when adapting to change:\n▶Step 1: Awareness.  This step identifies why the change is necessary.\n▶Step 2: Desire.  Once people know why the change is necessary, there needs to be a desire\nto be part of and support the change.\n▶Step 3: Knowledge.  People need to understand how to change. This includes\nunderstanding new processes and systems in addition to new roles and responsibilities.Knowledge can be imparted through training and education.\n▶Step 4: Ability. In this step, knowledge is supported with hands-on practice and access toexpertise and help as needed.\n▶Step 5: Reinforcement.  Reinforcement supports the sustainment of the change. This can\ninclude rewards, recognition, feedback, and measurement.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021162\nPMBOK® Guide4.2.4.3  The 8-Step Process for Leading Change\nJohn Kotter introduced the 8-Step Process for Leading Change for transforming organizations. \nIt is a top-down approach where the need for and approach to change originates at the top levels of \nthe organization, and then is promoted down through the organization’s layers of management to the change recipients. The eight steps are:\n▶Step 1: Create urgency. Identify potential threats and opportunities that drive the needfor change.\n▶Step 2: Form a powerful coalition.  Identify the change leaders. Change leaders are not\nnecessarily based on hierarchy. The change leaders should be influential people from\na variety of roles, expertise, social, and political importance.\n▶Step 3: Create a vision for change.  Identify the values that are central to the change.\nThen create a brief vision statement that summarizes the change. Next, identify a strategyto realize the vision.\n▶Step 4: Communicate the vision. Communicate the vision throughout the changeprocess. Apply the vision throughout all aspects of the organization. Senior managementand the change coalition should consistently communicate the vision and demonstrate\nthe urgency and benefits of the change.\n▶Step 5: Remove obstacles.  All change comes with obstacles. Sometimes the obstacles\nare outdated processes, sometimes they are based on the organizational structure,\nand sometimes they are people resistant to change. Regardless, all obstacles need\nto be addressed.\n▶Step 6: Create short-term wins.  Identify quick and easy wins to build momentum\nand support for the change.\n▶Step 7: Build on the change. Once the short-term wins are complete, the organizationneeds to set goals for continued improvement.\n▶Step 8: Anchor the changes in corporate culture.  Ensure the change becomes ingrained\ninto the culture: continue to communicate the vision, tell success stories, recognize peoplein the organization who embody and empower the change, and continue to support thechange coalition.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021163\nSection 4 – Models, Methods, and Artifacts4.2.4.4  Virginia Satir Change Model\nVirginia Satir developed a model of how people experience and cope with change. Its purpose \nis to help project team members understand what they are feeling and enable them to move through \nchange more efficiently.\n▶Late status quo. This initial stage is when everything feels familiar and can becharacterized as “business as usual.” For some people, business as usual may be goodbecause they know what to expect. For others, this status may feel a bit stale or boring.\n▶The foreign element.  Something happens that shifts the status quo in this stage. This may\ninclude initiating a project that introduces change to people’s usual way of working. Thereis often a period of resistance and reduction in performance after the change is introduced.People may ignore the change or dismiss its relevance.\n▶Chaos. People are in unfamiliar territory. They are no longer comfortable, and performancedrops to its lowest level. Feelings, actions, and behaviors are unpredictable. Some peoplefeel anxious, others may shut down, and some individuals may feel excited. Chaos canmake people very creative as they try to find ways to make sense of the situation. They tryvarious ideas and behaviors to see which of these has a positive outcome.\n▶The transforming idea.  People come to a point where they come up with an idea that\nhelps them make sense of the situation. They begin to see how they can find a way out ofthe chaos and cope with the new reality. Work performance begins to increase.\n▶Practice and integration.  People try to implement their new ideas or behaviors. There\nmay be setbacks and a period of trial and error, but eventually they learn what works andwhat doesn’t. This leads to improved performance. Often performance is at a higher levelthan it was before the foreign element was introduced.\n▶New status quo. People get used to the new environment, and their performancestabilizes. Eventually, the new status quo becomes the normal way of working.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021164\nPMBOK® Guide4.2.4.5  Transition Model\nWilliam Bridges’ Transition Model provides an understanding of what occurs to individuals \npsychologically when an organizational change takes place.

This model differentiates between change \nand transition. Change is situational and happens whether or not people transition through it.  \nTransition is a psychological process where people gradually accept the details of the new situation and the changes that come with it.\nThe model identifies three stages of transition associated with change:\n▶Ending, losing, and letting go. The change is introduced in this stage. It is oftenassociated with fear, anger, upset, uncertainty, denial, and resistance to the change.\n▶The neutral zone. The change is happening in this stage. In some instances, people mayfeel frustration, resentment, confusion, and anxiety about the change. Productivity maydrop as people learn new ways of doing work. In other instances, people may become verycreative, innovative, and passionate about trying new ways of working.\n▶The new beginning. At this point, people accept and even embrace the change. They arebecoming more adept at the new skills and the new ways of working. People are often\nopen to learning and are energized by the change.\n4.2.5  COMPLEXITY MODELS\nProjects exist in a state of ambiguity and require interactions among multiple systems, often \nwith uncertain outcomes. Complexity is a challenge to work with. The two models described in Sections 4.2.5.1 and 4.2.5.2 provide a framework to understand complexity and determine how to make decisions in a complex environment.\n4.2.5.1 Cynefin  Framework\nThe Cynefin framework, created by Dave Snowden, is a conceptual framework used to diagnose \ncause-and-effect relationships as a decision-making aid. The framework offers five problem and decision-making contexts:\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021165\nSection 4 – Models, Methods, and Artifacts▶Where there is an obvious cause-and-effect relationship, best practices are used to make\ndecisions.\n▶Complicated relationships exist when there is a set of known unknowns or a range\nof correct answers. In these situations, it is best to assess the facts, analyze the situation,\nand apply good practices.\n▶Complex relationships include unknown unknowns. There is no apparent cause and effect,\nand there are no obvious right answers. In complex environments, one should probe theenvironment, sense the situation, and respond with action. This style uses emergent practicesthat allow for repeated cycles of probe-sense-respond as complex environments change inreaction to multiple stimuli, and what worked once may not be effective the next time.\n▶In chaotic environments, the cause and effects are unclear. There is too much confusion\nto wait to understand the situation. In these situations, the first step is to take action to tryand stabilize the situation, then sense where there is some stability, and respond by takingsteps to get the chaotic situation to a complex situation.\n▶Disordered relationships lack clarity and may require breaking them into smaller parts\nwhose context links with one of the other four contexts.\nThe Cynefin framework helps identify behaviors, such as probing, sensing, responding, acting, \nand categorizing, which can help impact the relationships between variables and guide actions.\n4.2.5.2  Stacey Matrix\nRalph Stacey developed the Stacey matrix which is similar to the Cynefin framework, but it looks \nat two dimensions to determine the relative complexity of a project: (a) the relative uncertainty of the requirements for the deliverable, and (b) the relative uncertainty of the technology that will be used to create the deliverable. Based on the relative uncertainty of these dimensions, a project is considered simple, complicated, complex, or chaotic. The degree of complexity is one factor that influences tailoring methods and practices for the project.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021166\nPMBOK® Guide4.2.6  PROJECT TEAM DEVELOPMENT MODELS\nProject teams move through different stages of development. Understanding the stage of the \nteam in its development helps project managers support the project team and its growth. The two \nmodels presented in Sections 4.2.6.1 and 4.2.6.2 illustrate how project teams move through different stages to become high-performing project teams.\n4.2.6.1  Tuckman Ladder\nBruce Tuckman articulated the stages of team development as forming, storming, norming, and \nperforming. Many people add a fifth stage, adjourning.\n▶Forming.  The project team first comes together. Members get to know each other’s name,\nposition on the project team, skill sets, and other pertinent background information. Thismight occur in the kickoff meeting.\n▶Storming.  Project team members jockey for position on the team. This phase is where\npeople’s personalities, strengths, and weaknesses start to come out. There might be someconflict or struggle as people figure out how to work together. Storming might go on forsome time or pass relatively quickly.\n▶Norming.  The project team starts to function as a collective body. At this point, project team\nmembers know their places on the team and how they relate to and interface with all theother members. They are starting to work together. There might be some challenges as workprogresses, but these issues are resolved quickly, and the project team moves into action.\n▶Performing.  The project team becomes operationally efficient. This is the mature project\nteam stage. Project teams that have been together for a while are able to develop asynergy. By working together, project team members accomplish",

This is the mature project\nteam stage. Project teams that have been together for a while are able to develop asynergy. By working together, project team members accomplish more and produce\na high-quality product.\n▶Adjourning.  The project team completes the work and disperses to work on other things.\nIf the project team has formed good relationships, some project team members might besad about leaving the project team.\nThe project team culture in this model starts in the forming stage and evolves throughout the \nrest of the development stages. While this model shows a linear progression, project teams can move back and forth between theses stages. In addition, not all project teams achieve the performing or even the norming stages.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021167\nSection 4 – Models, Methods, and Artifacts4.2.6.2  Drexler/Sibbet Team Performance Model\nAllan Drexler and David Sibbet developed a team performance model with seven steps. Steps \n1 through 4 describe the stages in creating a project team, and steps 5 through 7 cover project team \nsustainability and performance.\n▶Step 1: Orientation.  Orientation answers the question of why. In this stage, the project\nteam learns the purpose and mission for the project. This usually occurs at a kickoffmeeting, or is documented in a business case, project charter, or lean start-up canvas.\n▶Step 2: Trust building. Trust building answers the question of who. This stage sheds light\non who is on the project team and the skills and abilities each person brings. It can alsoinclude information about key stakeholders who may not be part of the project team butcan influence the project team.\n▶Step 3: Goal clarification.  Goal clarification answers what. In this stage, the project team\nelaborates the high-level project information. This may include finding out more aboutstakeholder expectations, requirements, assumptions, and deliverable acceptance criteria.\n▶Step 4: Commitment. Commitment addresses the question of how. In this stage, the\nproject team starts to define plans to achieve the goals. This can include milestoneschedules, release plans, high-level budgets, resource needs, and so forth.\n▶Step 5: Implementation.  High-level plans are decomposed into greater levels of detail,\nsuch as a detailed schedule or backlog. The project team starts working together toproduce deliverables.\n▶Step 6: High performance.  After the project team has worked together for some time,\nproject team members reach a high level of performance. They work well together, don’tneed much oversight, and experience synergies within the project team.\n▶Step 7: Renewal. Renewal is the stage of working through changes on the project team orthe project. The deliverables, stakeholders, environment, project team leadership, or teammembership may change. This causes the project team to consider if the past behavior\nand actions are still sufficient, or if the project team needs to go back to a previous stage\nto reset the expectations and ways of working together.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021168\nPMBOK® Guide4.2.7  OTHER MODELS\nThe models described in Sections 4.2.7.1 through 4.2.7.5 cover a wide range of topics, including \nconflict management, negotiation, planning, Process Groups, and salience.\n4.2.7.1 Conflict  Model\nConflict is common on projects. Conflict can be healthy and productive when handled well.  \nIt can result in greater trust among project team members and a deeper commitment to the \noutcomes. Fear of conflict can restrict communication and creativity. However, conflict can be unhealthy as well. Addressing conflict inappropriately can lead to dissatisfaction, lack of trust, and reduced morale and motivation. The model based on work by Ken Thomas and Ralph Kilmann describes six ways of addressing conflict by focusing on the relative power between the individuals and the desire to maintain a good relationship as follows:\n▶Confronting/problem solving.  Confronting a conflict treats the conflict as a problem to\nbe solved. This style of conflict resolution is used when the relationship between parties isimportant, and when each person has confidence in the other party’s ability to problem-solve.\n▶Collaborating.  Collaborating involves incorporating multiple views about the conflict.\nThe objective is to learn about the various views and see things from multiple perspectives.This is an effective method when there is trust among the participants and when there istime to come to consensus. A project manager may facilitate this type of conflict resolutionbetween project team members.\n▶Compromising.  There are some conflicts in which all parties will not be fully satisfied. In\nthose instances, finding a way to compromise is the best approach. Compromise entailsa willingness to give and take. This allows all parties to get something they want, and itavoids escalating the conflict. This style is often used when the parties involved have equal“power.” A project manager may compromise with a technical manager regarding theavailability of a project team member to work on the project.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021169\nSection 4 – Models, Methods, and Artifacts▶Smoothing/accommodating.

Forcing is used when there is not enough time to collaborate or problem-solve.\nIn this scenario, one party forces their will on the other. The party forcing has more powerthan the other party. A forcing style may be used if there is a health and safety conflict thatneeds to be resolved immediately.\n▶Withdrawal/avoiding.  Sometimes a problem will go away on its own, or sometimes\ndiscussions get heated and people need a cooling-off period. In both scenarios,withdrawing from the situation is appropriate. Withdrawal is also used in a no-winscenario, such as complying with a requirement imposed by a regulatory agency insteadof challenging the requirement.\n4.2.7.2  Negotiation\nThere are many models for negotiation. One model is Steven Covey’s principle of “Think Win-Win.” \nThis principle applies to all interactions, not just negotiations, but it is described here in the context  \nof negotiation. In negotiations, there are different possible outcomes:\n▶Win-win. This is the optimal outcome, where each person is satisfied with the outcome.\n▶Win-lose/lose-win.  This describes a competition perspective where in order to win,\nsomeone else loses. It may also come from a martyr perspective where someone choosesto lose so that others can win.\n▶Lose-lose.  This outcome can occur when win-win outcomes may have been possible, but\ncompetition overwhelms collaboration. In this scenario, everyone ends up worse off.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021170\nPMBOK® GuideA win-win perspective is generally found when the following aspects are present:\n▶Character.  The parties involved are mature, demonstrate integrity, and share the\nperspective that there is enough value for everybody.\n▶Trust. The parties trust each other, establish agreements on how to operate, and are\naccountable.\n▶Approach.  Each party is willing to look at the situation from the other’s point of view. The\nparties work together to identify key issues and concerns. They identify what an acceptablesolution looks like and identify options to achieve an acceptable solution.\n4.2.7.3 Planning\nBarry Boehm developed a model that compares the time and effo rt invested in developing \nplans to reduce risk, including the delay and other costs asso ciated with overplanning. By taking \nmore time to plan up front, many projects can reduce uncertai nty, oversights, and rework. However, \nthe longer the time spent planning, t he longer it takes to get a return on investment, the more \nmarket share could be lost, and the more circumstances can change by the time the output is \ndelivered. The intent of this model is to help identify the  optimum amount of planning, somet imes \ncalled the sweet spot. The sweet spot  is different for every project; therefore, there is no correct \nanswer for the right amount of planning overall. This model demo nstrates that there is a point \nwhere additional planning becomes counterproductive.\n4.2.7.4 Process Groups\nProject management processes can be organized into logical groupings of project management \ninputs, tools and techniques, and outputs that are tailored to meet the needs of the organization, \nstakeholders, and the project.\nGroups of processes are not project phases. The Process Groups interact within each phase \nof a project life cycle. It is possible that all of these processes could occur within a single phase. \nProcesses may be iterated within a phase or life cycle. The number of iterations and interactions \nbetween processes varies based on the needs of the project.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021171\nSection 4 – Models, Methods, and ArtifactsProjects that follow a process-based approach may use the following five process groupings \nas an organizing structure:\n▶Initiating.  Those processes performed to define a new project or a new phase of an\nexisting project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase.\n▶Planning. Those processes required to establish the scope of the project, refine the\nobjectives, and define the course of action required to attain the objectives that the projectwas undertaken to achieve.\n▶Executing. Those processes performed to complete the work defined in the projectmanagement plan to satisfy the project requirements.\n▶Monitoring and Controlling.  Those processes required to track, review, and regulate the\nprogress and performance of the project; identify any areas in which changes to the planare required; and initiate the corresponding changes.\n▶Closing.  Those processes performed to formally complete or close a project, phase,\nor contract.\nThese Process Groups are independent of the delivery approach, application areas (such as \nmarketing, information services, and accounting), or industry (such as construction, aerospace, and telecommunications). In a process-based approach, the output of one process generally becomes an input to another process or is a deliverable of the project or project phase. For example, a project management plan and project documents, such as the risk register, assumption log, etc., which are produced in the planning process grouping, are inputs to the executing process",

For example, a project management plan and project documents, such as the risk register, assumption log, etc., which are produced in the planning process grouping, are inputs to the executing process grouping where updates are made to associated artifacts.\n4.2.7.5  Salience Model\nThe Salience Model is about stakeholders. Salience means prominent, noticeable, or perceived \nas important. This model was proposed by Ronald K. Mitchell, Bradley R. Agle, and Donna J. Wood. The authors denoted a stakeholder identification based on three variables: power to influence, legitimacy of the stakeholders’ relationships with the project, and the urgency of the stakeholders' claim on the project for stakeholder engagement.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021172\nPMBOK® Guide4.3 MODELS APPLIED ACROSS PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nDifferent models are more likely to be useful in different project performance domains. While \nthe needs of the project, stakeholders, and organizational environment will determine which models \nare most applicable for a specific project, there are some performance domains that are more likely to make use of each model. Table 4-1 suggests the performance domain(s) where each model is most likely to be of use; however, the project manager and project team have the ultimate responsibility for selecting the right models for their project.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021173\nSection 4 – Models, Methods, and ArtifactsTable 4-1.

The \nmethods described here are a sampling of those commonly used to support project work. There are \nmany methods that are not described here, either because they are used in project management the same way they are in other disciplines, such as interviewing, focus groups, checklists, and so forth, or because they are not frequently used across a broad spectrum of projects (i.e., the methods are industry specific).\nMany of the methods are related by the purpose they serve, such as estimating or data gathering, \nand therefore, are presented in a group. Others are related by the type of activity involved, such as those in the meetings and analysis groups.\nThe content in this section is not meant to describe how a method is performed. The \ndescriptions are presented at a high level with more detailed information available from many sources, including PMIstandards+.\n4.4.1  DATA GATHERING AND ANALYSIS\nData gathering and analysis methods are used to collect, assess, and evaluate data and \ninformation to gain a deeper understanding of a situation. The outputs of data analysis may be organized and presented as one of the artifacts shown in Section 4.6.6. The data gathering and analysis methods described here, coupled with the artifacts described in Section 4.6.6, are often used to inform decisions.\n▶Alternatives analysis.  Alternatives analysis is used to evaluate identified options in order\nto select the options or approaches to perform the work of the project.\n▶Assumption and constraint analysis.  An assumption is a factor that is considered to\nbe true, real, or certain, without proof or demonstration. A constraint is a limiting factorthat affects the execution of a project, program, portfolio, or process. This form of analysisensures that assumptions and constraints are integrated into the project plans anddocuments, and that there is consistency among them.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021175\nSection 4 – Models, Methods, and Artifacts▶Benchmarking. Benchmarking is the comparison of actual or planned products, processes,\nand practices to those of comparable organizations, which identifies best practices,generates ideas for improvement, and provides a basis for measuring performance.\n▶Business justification analysis methods.  This group of analysis methods is associated\nwith authorizing or justifying a project or a decision. The outcomes of the following analysesare often used in a business case that justifies undertaking a project:\n▹Payback period. The payback period is the time needed to recover",

This group of analysis methods is associated\nwith authorizing or justifying a project or a decision. The outcomes of the following analysesare often used in a business case that justifies undertaking a project:\n▹Payback period. The payback period is the time needed to recover an investment,usually in months or years.\n▹Internal rate of return (IRR). The internal rate of return is the projected annual yield\nof a project investment, incorporating both initial and ongoing costs into an estimatedpercentage growth rate a given project is expected to have.\n▹Return on investment (ROI).  Return on investment is the percent return on an initial\ninvestment, calculated by taking the projected average of all net benefits and dividingthem by the initial cost.\n▹Net present value (NPV).  Net present value is the future value of expected benefits,\nexpressed in the value those benefits have at the time of investment. NPV considerscurrent and future costs and benefits and inflation.\n▹Cost-benefit analysis.  A cost-benefit analysis is a financial analysis tool used to determine\nthe benefits provided by a project against its costs.\n▶Check sheet. A check sheet is a tally sheet that can be used as a checklist when gatheringdata. Check sheets can be used to collect and segregate data into categories. Check sheetscan also be used to create histograms and matrices as described in Section 4.6.6.\n▶Cost of quality. The cost of quality includes all costs incurred over the life of the productby investment in preventing nonconformance to requirements, appraisal of the product orservice for conformance to requirements, and failure to meet requirements.\n▶Decision tree analysis.  A decision tree analysis is a diagramming and calculation method\nfor evaluating the implications of a chain of multiple options in the presence of uncertainty.Decision trees can use the information generated from an expected monetary valueanalysis to populate the branches of the decision tree.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021176\nPMBOK® Guide▶Earned value analysis.  Earned value analysis is a method that utilizes a set of measures\nassociated with scope, schedule, and cost to determine the cost and schedule performance\nof a project.\n▶Expected monetary value (EMV).  The expected monetary value is the estimated value\nof an outcome expressed in monetary terms. It is used to quantify the value of uncertainty,such as a risk, or compare the value of alternatives that are not necessarily equivalent. TheEMV is calculated by multiplying the probability that an event will occur and the economicimpact the event would have should it occur.\n▶Forecast.  A forecast is an estimate or prediction of conditions and events in the project’s\nfuture, based on information and knowledge available at the time of the forecast.Qualitative forecasting methods use the opinions and judgments of subject matter experts.Quantitative forecasting uses models where past information is used to predict futureperformance. Causal or econometric forecasting, such as regression analysis, identifiesvariables that can have significant impact on future outcomes.\n▶Influence diagram. This diagram is a graphical representation of situations showingcausal influences, time ordering of events, and other relationships among variables\nand outcomes.\n▶Life cycle assessment.  This assessment is a tool used to evaluate the total environmental\nimpact of a product, process, or system. It includes all aspects of producing a projectdeliverable, from the origin of materials used in the deliverable to its distribution andultimate disposal.\n▶Make-or-buy analysis.  A make-or-buy analysis is the process of gathering and organizing\ndata about product requirements and analyzing them against available alternatives such\nas the purchase versus internal manufacture of the product.\n▶Probability and impact matrix.  A probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the\nprobability of occurrence of each risk and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs.\n▶Process analysis.  This analysis is a systematic review of the steps and procedures to\nperform an activity.\n▶Regression analysis.  A regression analysis is an analytical technique where a series of\ninput variables are examined in relation to their corresponding output results in order todevelop a mathematical or statistical relationship.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021177\nSection 4 – Models, Methods, and Artifacts▶Reserve analysis.  This analytical technique is used to evaluate the amount of risk on\nthe project and the amount of schedule and budget reserve to determine whether the\nreserve is sufficient for the remaining risk. The reserve contributes to reducing risk to anacceptable level.\n▶Root cause analysis.  This analytical technique is used to determine the basic underlying\ncause of a variance, defect, or a risk. A root cause may underlie more than one variance,defect, or risk.\n▶Sensitivity analysis.  This analytical technique is used to determine which individual project\nrisks or other sources of uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes bycorrelating variations in project outcomes with variations in elements of a quantitative riskanalysis model.\n▶Simulations.  This analytical technique uses models to show the combined effect of\nuncertainties in order to evaluate their potential impact on objectives. A Monte Carlosimulation is a method of identifying the potential impacts of risk and uncertainty usingmultiple iterations of a computer model to develop a probability distribution of a range ofoutcomes that could result from a decision or course of action.\n▶Stakeholder analysis.  This technique involves systematically gathering and analyzing\nquantitative and qualitative information about stakeholders to determine whose interestsshould be taken into account throughout the project.\n▶SWOT analysis. A SWOT analysis assesses the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, andthreats of an organization, project, or option.\n▶Trend analysis.  A trend analysis",

This analytical technique evaluates scenarios in order to\npredict their effect on project objectives.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021178\nPMBOK® Guide4.4.2  ESTIMATING\nEstimating methods are used to develop an approximation of work, time, or cost on a project.\n▶Affinity grouping. Affinity grouping involves classifying items into similar categories or\ncollections on the basis of their likeness. Common affinity groupings include T-shirt sizingand Fibonacci numbers.\n▶Analogous estimating.  Analogous estimating assesses the duration or cost of an activity\nor a project using historical data from a similar activity or project.\n▶Function point. A function point is an estimate of the amount of business functionality inan information system. Function points are used to calculate a functional size measurement(FSM) of a software system.\n▶Multipoint estimating.  Multipoint estimating assesses cost or duration by applying an\naverage or weighted average of optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimates whenthere is uncertainty with the individual activity estimates.\n▶Parametric estimating.  Parametric estimating uses an algorithm to calculate cost or\nduration based on historical data and project parameters.\n▶Relative estimating.  Relative estimating is used to create estimates that are derived from\nperforming a comparison against a similar body of work, taking effort, complexity, anduncertainty into consideration. Relative estimating is not necessarily based on absolute unitsof cost or time. Story points are a common unitless measure used in relative estimating.\n▶Single-point estimating.  Single-point estimating involves using data to calculate a single\nvalue that reflects a best-guess estimate. A single-point estimate is opposed to a rangeestimate, which includes the best- and worst-case scenario.\n▶Story point estimating.  Story point estimating involves project team members assigning\nabstract, but relative, points of effort required to implement a user story. It tells the projectteam about the difficulty of the story considering the complexity, risks, and effort involved.\n▶Wideband Delphi.  Wideband Delphi is a variation of the Delphi estimating method where\nsubject matter experts complete multiple rounds of producing estimates individually, witha project team discussion after each round, until a consensus is achieved. For WidebandDelphi, those who created the highest and lowest estimates explain their rationale,following which everyone reestimates. The process repeats until convergence is achieved.Planning poker is a variation of Wideband Delphi.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021179\nSection 4 – Models, Methods, and Artifacts4.4.3  MEETINGS AND EVENTS\nMeetings are an important means for engaging the project team and other stakeholders. They \nare a primary means of communication throughout the project.\n▶Backlog refinement.  At a backlog refinement meeting, the backlog is progressively\nelaborated and (re)prioritized to identify the work that can be accomplished in an\nupcoming iteration.\n▶Bidder conference.  Meetings with prospective sellers prior to the preparation of a bid\nor proposal to ensure all prospective vendors have a clear and common understanding\nof the procurement. This meeting may also be known as contractor conferences, vendorconferences, or pre-bid conferences.\n▶Change control board.  A change control board meeting includes the group of people\nwho are accountable for reviewing, evaluating, approving, delaying, or rejecting changesto the project. The decisions made at this meeting are recorded and communicated to theappropriate stakeholders. This meeting may also be referred to as a change control meeting.\n▶Daily standup. A standup is a brief collaboration meeting during which the project teamreviews its progress from the previous day, declares intentions for the current day, andhighlights any obstacles encountered or anticipated. This meeting may also be referred toas a daily scrum.\n▶Iteration planning.  An iteration planning meeting is used to clarify the details of the\nbacklog items, acceptance criteria, and work effort required to meet an upcoming iterationcommitment. This meeting may also be referred to as a sprint planning meeting.\n▶Iteration review.  An iteration review is held at the end of an iteration to demonstrate the\nwork that was accomplished during the iteration. This meeting may also be referred to as asprint review.\n▶Kickoff.  A kickoff meeting is a gathering of project team members and other key\nstakeholders at the outset of a project to formally set expectations, gain a commonunderstanding, and commence work. It establishes the start of a project, phase,\nor iteration.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021180\nPMBOK® Guide▶Lessons learned meeting.

There are many documents \nor deliverables that are not described here, either because (a) they are somewhat generic, such as \nupdates; (b) they are industry specific; or (c) they are a result of a specific method that was used to create it, for example, while cost estimates are an important artifact, they are the result of various estimating methods.\nThe content in this section is not meant to describe how to develop or create an artifact.  \nThe descriptions are presented at a high level as project managers and/or project team members are expected to tailor the use of these artifacts to meet the needs of their particular project. There is more detailed information on these and other artifacts from many sources, including PMIstandards+.\n4.6.1  STRATEGY ARTIFACTS\nDocuments that are created prior to or at the start of the project that address strategic, business, \nor high-level information about the project. Strategy artifacts are developed at the start of a project and do not normally change, though they may be reviewed throughout the project.\n▶Business case.  A business case is a value proposition for a proposed project that may\ninclude financial and nonfinancial benefits.\n▶Business model canvas.  This artifact is a one-page visual summary that describes the\nvalue proposition, infrastructure, customers, and finances. These are often used in leanstart-up situations.\n▶Project brief.  A project brief provides a high-level overview of the goals, deliverables, and\nprocesses for the project.\n▶Project charter.  A project charter is a document issued by the project initiator or sponsor\nthat formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides the project manager withthe authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.\n▶Project vision statement.  This document is a concise, high-level description of the project\nthat states the purpose, and inspires the project team to contribute to the project.\n▶Roadmap. This document provides a high-level time line that depicts milestones, significantevents, reviews, and decision points.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021185\nSection 4 – Models, Methods, and Artifacts4.6.2  LOGS AND REGISTERS\nLogs and registers are used to record continuously evolving aspects of the project. They are \nupdated throughout the project.

TownsendBarbara Walsh, CSPODaniel Wiser\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021207\nAppendix X2X2.1 INTRODUCTION\nResearch shows that an active project sponsor is a critical success factor in achieving positive \noutcomes from projects. This appendix describes the actions and impacts of sponsors and how these \nfactors contribute to the overall success of the project.\nX2.2 THE SPONSOR ROLE\nDepending on the organization, a project typically has a sponsor. The project sponsor provides \ndecision leadership that is outside of the authority and position power of the project manager and project team. Active engagement and oversight by a project sponsor supports the project manager, the project team, and ultimately drives project outcomes. The sponsor also links the project team with the strategy and big-picture view at the executive level of the organization.\nSponsors perform the following functions, among others:\n▶Communicate the vision, goals, and expectations to the team.\n▶Advocate for the project and the team.\n▶Facilitate executive-level decisions.\n▶Help secure resources.\n▶Keep projects aligned to business objectives.\n▶Remove obstacles.\n▶Address issues outside the project team’s authority.\n▶Bring opportunities that arise within the project to senior management.\n▶Monitor project outcomes after closure to ensure intended business benefits are realized.Appendix X2\nSponsor\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021208\nPMBOK® GuideThe sponsor’s position within the organization and the perspective from that level enable the \nsponsor to provide key support to the team in the following areas:\n▶Vision.  Establish and/or communicate the vision and direction for the project.\n▶Business value.  Work with the team consistently to maintain alignment with the\nstrategic and business objectives. When the market, competition, and strategy are volatile\nand evolving, this may require frequent interactions to adjust project work to meet theevolving direction.\n▶Customer focus.  Balance various stakeholder needs and priorities. When there are\nmultiple stakeholders, especially stakeholders with conflicting needs, it may be necessary\nto prioritize stakeholder needs and make trade-offs.\n▶Decisions.  Make decisions or direct decisions to the appropriate individual or group when\nthere are decisions to be made that are outside of the project team’s authority. If the teamcannot come to a decision or if the team is in conflict, sponsors can mediate conflict andfacilitate the decision-making process.\n▶Motivation. Sponsors serve as a source of motivation for the project team by activelyengaging with and supporting them.\n▶Accountability.  Depending on the authority level of the role, sponsors are often\naccountable for the project outcomes. In this role, they may accept or reject thedeliverables for the project.\nX2.3 LACK OF ENGAGEMENT\nWhen the sponsor is not engaged or when that role is vacant, many of the benefits associated \nwith the activities listed in Section X2.2 are missing. This may have a negative impact on project effectiveness. Project performance suffers because there are often longer decision time frames and conflicting priorities. If the sponsor is not helping to secure resources, that gap can impact access to necessary team members or acquisition of physical resources. When there is no direct sponsor support, team members may be removed or switched out. These changes can cause negative impacts to scope, quality, schedule, and budget and diminish the probability of achieving intended outcomes and stakeholder satisfaction.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021209\nAppendix X2X2.4 SPONSOR BEHAVIORS\nThere are certain behaviors that sponsors display that can help teams perform effectively and \nthus improve project outcomes:\n▶Resource.  Liaise with the organization to ensure the team has the necessary skill sets\nand the physical resources needed to deliver the project.\n▶Guide.  Provide a motivating vision around which the team can rally.\n▶Align. Maintain alignment between the organization’s strategic goals and the project\noutcomes. If the market changes or the organization’s goals shift, work with the projectteam to pivot the direction of the project to meet the current needs.\n▶Tailor.  Work alongside the team to tailor the structure, culture, processes, roles, and work\nto optimize outcomes.\n▶Influence. Enable the needed changes for adoption to the post-project operations.\nThis includes leadership, engagement, and collaboration with stakeholders throughout\nthe organization.\n▶Communicate. Provide an ongoing exchange of information from the organization\nto the team and from the team to the organization.\n▶Partner. Partner with the team in achieving success. This can include coaching, mentoring,and demonstrating a personal commitment to the project goal.\n▶Check. Engage with the team to stimulate critical thinking by asking questions, challengingassumptions, and fostering innovation.\n▶Unblock.  Remove impediments and barriers and resolve issues that are outside the team’s\nauthority or ability to address.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021210\nPMBOK® GuideX2.5  CONCLUSION\nThe strategic link that the sponsor provides both empowers and enables the project team  \nto optimize its performance by maintaining alignment with the organization’s strategy.

In the \ncontext of the PMBOK® Guide – Seventh Edition, the project management office (PMO) represents \na management structure that standardizes project-related governance processes and facilitates \nthe sharing of resources, tools, methodologies, and techniques. Recognizing that the character and function of a PMO varies between organizations, and even within the same organization, this appendix outlines common attributes among PMOs and discusses how PMOs support project work.\nX3.2 THE PMO VALUE PROPOSITION—WHY HAVE ONE?\nOrganizations establish PMOs for a variety of reasons but with one core benefit in mind: \nimproved project management in terms of schedule, cost, quality, risk, and other facets. PMOs have many potential roles in aligning work with strategic goals: engaging and collaborating with stakeholders, developing talent, and realizing value from investments in projects.Appendix X3\nThe Project Management Office\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021212\nPMBOK® GuidePMOs can take multiple forms. Understanding how PMOs are utilized in organizations as well \nas assigned roles and responsibilities sheds light on the range of benefits PMOs can deliver:\n▶Some PMOs provide project management guidance that supports consistency in how\nprojects are delivered. These PMOs may provide guidelines, templates, and examples\nof good practices along with training and coaching. Standardized approaches and toolspromote a common business picture across projects and facilitate decisions that transcendindividual project concerns. This type of PMO often exists in organizations that are juststarting to improve their project management capabilities.\n▶A PMO may offer project support services for planning activities, risk management, project\nperformance tracking, and similar activities. This shared services model of a PMO oftenexists in organizations with independent or diverse business units that want support withdelivery while maintaining more direct control over their projects.\n▶PMOs can be part of a department or business unit and oversee a portfolio of projects.\nOversight can include such activities as requiring a business case to initiate a project,allocating financial and other resources to deliver the project, approving requests to changeproject scope or activities, and similar functions. This type of PMO provides centralizedmanagement of projects. This structure exists in organizations that have departments withmultiple projects and that deliver strategically important results, such as IT capabilities ornew product development.\n▶An organization may have an enterprise-level PMO (EPMO) that links implementation\nof organizational strategy with portfolio-level investments in programs and projects thatdeliver specific results, changes, or products. This structure exists in organizations withwell-established project management capabilities that are directly linked to achievingorganizational strategy and broad business objectives.\n▶Organizations with flatter structures, customer-centered initiatives, and more adaptive\ndelivery approaches may adopt an Agile Center of Excellence (ACoE) or Value DeliveryOffice (VDO) structure. The ACoE/VDO serves an enabling role, rather than a managementor oversight function. It focuses on coaching teams, building agile skills and capabilitiesthroughout the organization, and mentoring sponsors and product owners to be moreeffective in those roles. This type of structure is emerging wit\nhin organizations adopting more\ndecentralized structures where teams need to respond quickly to changing customer needs.\nPMOs may be layered. For example, an EPMO may have subordinate PMOs and VDOs that \nreside within specific departments. Such layering supports strategic alignment at the EPMO level and specific project management capabilities within the departmental PMO or VDO.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021213",

Such layering supports strategic alignment at the EPMO level and specific project management capabilities within the departmental PMO or VDO.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021213\nAppendix X3The formation of any type of PMO or VDO is based on organizational needs. Key influencers \nthat help to shape the PMO or VDO include the types of projects being delivered, the size of the \norganization, its structure(s), the degree of centralized/decentralized decision making, and corporate culture. As organizational needs change over time, PMOs and VDOs evolve in response. For example, a PMO may transform into a VDO or the PMO may be closed after fulfilling its charter.\nX3.3 KEY PMO CAPABILITIES\nThe Standard for Project Management  states that projects are part of a system for value delivery \nwithin organizations. PMOs can support that system and are a part of the system. Just as project teams need specific capabilities to deliver results, so do PMOs. Effective PMOs make three key contributions that support value delivery:\n▶Fostering delivery and outcomes-oriented capabilities.  PMOs foster project\nmanagement capabilities. They ensure that employees, contractors, partners, etc., whoare within and outside of the PMO, understand, develop, apply, and value a range ofproject management skills and competencies. They focus on right-sizing processes andgovernance, based on the unique characteristics of each project to produce high-qualityresults efficiently, quickly, and effectively.\n▶Keeping the “big picture” perspective.  Staying true to the goals of a project remains a\nkey element of success. Scope creep and new priorities not aligned to strategic or businessgoals can allow projects to drift off course. Strong PMOs evaluate the performance ofprojects with an eye toward continuous improvement. They evaluate work in the context\nof the organization’s overall success rather than maximizing a specific project’s results.\nThey provide project teams, senior management, and business leaders with informationand guidance that help them understand current circumstances and options in support\nof decision making.\n▶Continuous improvement, knowledge transfer, and change management.\nStrong PMOs regularly share project results across the organization to transfer valuableknowledge gained from each project. Learning and sharing activities inform strategic andbusiness objectives while improving activities that strengthen future project delivery.Effective organizational change management builds and sustains alignment with processupdates, capability enhancements, and new skills that support project management.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021214\nPMBOK® GuideX3.4 EVOLVING FOR STRONGER BENEFITS REALIZATION\nFor many businesses, greater uncertainty, an accelerated pace of change, increased \ncompetition, and more empowered customers mean organizations produce value in an increasingly \ncomplex environment. The ability to implement new strategic initiatives and change rapidly is becoming a key differentiator. These changes are also exerting greater pressure on PMOs to demonstrate their contributions to benefits realization and value creation. PMOs are evolving to meet these challenges by:\n▶Focusing on critical initiatives.  While all projects are important, strategic initiatives\ncan significantly impact the organization’s future, its relationship with its stakeholders,and its capabilities. PMOs are shifting from being project watchdogs to orchestratingconversations between senior leaders, business unit heads, product owners, and projectteams. These conversations provide accurate insights into project performance, threats,and opportunities that can affect important strategic initiatives. Such focus promotesclarity and course correction around emerging issues and the fullest possible realization\nof business outcomes.\n▶Instituting smart and simple processes.  PMOs are right sizing their organization’s\ncapabilities by establishing just enough process and practice discipline to enable effectivecommunication, collaboration, and continuous improvement without adding wasteful\nsteps or overriding processes that are producing value.\n▶Fostering talent and capabilities.  PMOs are playing a more proactive role in recruiting\nand retaining talented team members. They are developing and nurturing technical,strategic, management, and leadership skills within project teams and across theorganization.\n▶Encouraging and enabling a culture of change. PMOs are becoming change leadersby actively building organization-wide support for and commitment to outcomes andbenefits-focused performance and organizational change management as competitivedifferentiators.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021215\nAppendix X3X3.5 LEARN MORE ABOUT PMOS\nThese PMI standards and guides provide additional information about the role of the PMO \nfrom different perspectives.

Product management is aligned with this value view and adds a longer time frame perspective. These concepts are shown  \nin Table X4-1.Appendix X4\nProduct\nTable X4-1. Views of Project and Product Management\nAttribute Product View Project View\nFocus Outcomes Outcomes\nTypical metrics Value Business va lue\nStaffing model Temporary teams Stable teams\nDelivery emphasis “Deliver va lue” accountability “Inception to retirement” accountability\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021218\nPMBOK® GuideThis appendix provides information about product development that raises tailoring \nconsiderations for teams to consider. It describes how products and services continue to develop \nand evolve through their use and over their lifetime. For purposes of this appendix, products, product management, and product life cycle are defined as:\nProduct.  A product is an artifact that is produced, is quantifiable, and can be either an end \nitem in itself or a component item.\nProduct management.\n Product management is the integration of people, data, processes,  \nand business systems to create, maintain, and evolve a product or service throughout its life cycle.\nProduct life cycle.  A product life cycle is a series of phases that represents the evolution \nof a product, from concept through delivery, growth, maturity, and to retirement.\nGiven these definitions, products extend beyond a project life cycle. They operate more like \nlong-running programs that focus on maximizing benefits realization. For example:\n▶The Apple iPhone® product has been through multiple versions with future updates on\nsomeone’s drawing board.\n▶Once they are finished, buildings and homes require ongoing maintenance to keep them\nfunctioning correctly and, at specific points, they may be refurbished or expanded fordifferent uses.\nContinuous development has impacts on many factors including, but not limited to, funding \nmodels, staffing models, development, and sustainment practices.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021219\nAppendix X4X4.2 GLOBAL MARKET SHIFTS\nThree global trends are disrupting traditional business models and transforming products and \nservices (see Figure X4-1).\n▶Customer centricity.  Customer centricity inverts the traditional model of organizations\ndeveloping products and pushing them out to customers. Today, organizations are changing\nto better understand, serve, and maintain customer loyalty (see Figure X4-2). Today’stechnology can capture a range of customer data and requirements that organizationsanalyze and use for potential product enhancements, cross-selling opportunities, newproduct ideas, etc.Customer Centricity\nProduct Manag ement Software-Enhanced Value\nOngoing Provision and Pa yment\nFigure X4-1. Global Business Trends Influencing the Management of Products\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021220\nPMBOK® Guide▶Software-enhanced value.  Software and the capabilities it can provide have become\nkey differentiators in a range of products and services today. Thirty years ago, software\nran predominantly on dedicated computers. Ten years ago, software was embedded\nin control systems for vehicles and homes as a result of enhanced wireless and satellite\ncommunication systems. Now, even the most mundane appliances run software that\nadds new capabilities and captures usage data.\nMost organizations conduct at least some portion of their transactional business\nelectronically through websites and applications. Due to the ongoing need to upgrade\nand maintain these systems, these services are only truly finished with development\nwhen the product or service is retired.\n▶Ongoing provision and payment. Changes to established economic models aretransforming many organizations. Single-transaction services are being replaced withcontinuous provision and payment.

A move away from buying DVDs and CDs from centralized outlets; instead,\na rise in subscription services with ongoing funding and delivery of benefits.\nX4.3 IMPACT ON PROJECT DELIVERY PRACTICES\nAs markets shift from a single project delivery model to an ongoing delivery model, some \norganizations are looking for alternatives to temporary project structures that deliver a single product, change, or service. Instead, they are looking for delivery constructs that have a strong customer focus, recognize the rapid evolution of technology, and align with the ongoing service and revenue streams of loyal customers.\nThese factors have led to an increased interest in and shift toward product management \nlife cycles for value delivery. Product management takes a longer life cycle view that encompasses support, sustainment, and ongoing evolution with the same team. Stable teams are especially valuable in complex and unique domains, such as systems with embedded software where knowledge transfer is time-consuming and costly. The shifting focus to product management is prompting some project-oriented organizations to adapt their delivery models.\nX4.4 ORGANIZATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS \nFOR PRODUCT MANAGEMENT\nOrganizations that are shifting to long-running, product-based environments can utilize \nseveral strategies to align and coordinate product management. Three strategies include, but are not limited to, the following (see also Figure X4-3):\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021222\nPMBOK® Guide▶Establish stable teams.  Instead of disbanding the team when initial development is\ncomplete, use that team to sustain and evolve the product with the designated product\nowner or person within the team reflecting the customer perspective. This removes theneed for knowledge transfer and reduces the risk of future enhancements being delayeddue to a loss of tacit knowledge.\nLong-standing teams also develop better market awareness, customer insights, and\ncustomer empathy than short-term teams. This helps with maintaining customer focusand customer loyalty and builds competitive advantage. When people know they will beresponsible for maintaining and enhancing a product, they are less likely to take shortcutsto get something ready for release. As a result, quality, maintainability, and extensibility areoften improved with \nlong-serving teams rather than with teams that develop then handover\nproducts. These factors, in turn, contribute to creating value and sustaining value delivery.Establish Stable Teams\nUse Incremental Funding Product Environment\nProgram Manag ement\nFigure X4-3. Supporting Strategies for Continuous Value Delivery\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021223\nAppendix X4Partners or contractors who develop initial products for deployment on a customer  \nsite incorporate effective change management to ensure customers have the capabilities \nto maintain the product once it is transitioned. Part of transition planning can include discussions on building a team within the receiving organization that can support and evolve the product over its life cycle.\n▶Use incremental guidance and funding.  Instead of predefined project durations or\nannual budgets, consider more frequent reviews (such as quarterly) and funding for thenext quarter. With more frequent evaluations and funding, the business is in closer controlof overall progress, direction, and decision making.\nSimilar to venture capital funding, regular reviews of delivered value allow direct funding\ntoward products that are providing expected value and reduce or curtail investment inunderperforming initiatives. Such funding models enable organizations to pursue newmarket opportunities and capitalize on successful endeavors while limiting exposure\nto the inevitable percentage of new initiatives that fail.\n▶Utilize program management structures.  Practitioners operating with stable teams\nthat support customer-centric products can apply program management constructs formanaging long-running initiatives. Programs align well with adjusting to market changesand focusing on customer benefits. They are also typically much longer running than\na single project.\nThe Standard for Program Management  addresses ongoing priority changes as follows:\n“The primary difference between projects and programs is based on the recognition withinprograms that the strategies for delivering benefits may need to be optimized adaptively asthe outcomes of components are individually realized. The best mechanisms for deliveringa program’s benefits may initially be ambiguous or uncertain.”\nThis acceptance of up-front uncertainty, need for adaptation, focus on benefits, and\nlonger time frames may make programs a better fit than projects for many organizationsmanaging product delivery.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021224\nPMBOK® GuideMany traditional product industries, such as infrastructure, aerospace, and automotive, \nuse program management guides and frameworks. These industries utilize programs \nfor directional alignment and integration of component activities, such as programs, subprograms, and project activities. For example, an organization with a technology platform can use program and product management to prioritize and oversee capabilities that will maximize the platform’s return on investment over its lifetime. A stable, continuous development team can work on customer-focused, value-adding features and functions. Project teams then deliver equipment upgrades and interfaces with new or enhanced systems. Operational teams can troubleshoot user interface issues and help customers adapt to new features. When program structures already exist in organizations, shifting to those structures for product management does not require reorienting everyone to a new way of thinking or working.\nTable X4-2.

Programs are much better \naligned with product thinking through their acceptance of up-front uncertainty, need for adaptation, focus on benefits, and longer time frames.\nX4.5 SUMMARY\nGlobal markets, increased diversification, and the addition of software to more products are \nresulting in extended support, sustainment, and time frames for realization of value. Customer-centric and digitally focused organizations are finding advantages in forming stable teams for the lifetime support and growth of these new classes of products.\nProduct life cycles may appear at odds with traditional project delivery constructs such as \nthe temporary nature of projects. However, they have many overlaps with the evolution of project thinking that includes focusing on customer value.\nOrganizations in such environments can find alignment and additional resources in creating \nlong-running stable teams, staged funding, and program management constructs.\nX4.6 SUGGESTED RESOURCES\nKelly, A. 2018.

Content includes:\n▶Rationale for a move to a principle-based standard,\n▶Overview of the research conducted prior to the development of the standard,\n▶Description of how the standard was developed, and\n▶Information on how the content in the standard was validated.\nX5.2 THE MOVE TO A PRINCIPLE-BASED STANDARD\nSince 2010, PMI’s standards program has included research in addition to practitioner \nexperience to develop standards. Academic research, market research, focus groups, and \npractitioner experience have been inputs when updating many of the standards documents, including The Standard for Project Management.\nAs early as 2012, research suggested a move away from a prescriptive, process-oriented standard \ntoward one that requires reflection to apply in practice. Since that time, many of PMI’s standards have moved to a principle-based format, such as The Standard for Program Management  – Third Edition \nand The Standard for Portfolio Management  – Fourth Edition. In addition, as part of supporting the \ndevelopment of ISO standards, PMI participated in discussions within ISO TC258\n1 regarding the need  \nto shift to a narrative- or principle-based approach and away from a process-based approach.\n1 International Organization for Standardization Technical Committee 258, Project, Programme, \nand Portfolio Management.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021228\nPMBOK® GuideComments by the review teams and exposure draft participants collectively affirmed the shift \nof The Standard for Project Management  away from a process-based approach to a principle-based \nstandard in keeping with research findings and practitioner need.\nX5.3 RESEARCH FOR THE STANDARD \nFOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT\nPrior to updating The Standard for Project Management , significant research and review were \nconducted, including:\n▶International project management standards or standards-like documents along with lean,\nagile, and design thinking principles and some of the mostly commonly used frameworks.\nThis research helped to identify common practice areas and themes that served as inputsinto developing the principles in the The Standard for Project Management .\n▶PMI research, such as Pulse of the Profession®, which indicated that more organizations\nand practitioners are embracing agile and hybrid models along with new ways of working(i.e., tools, frameworks, technologies, etc.).\n▶Review of published white papers, thought leadership articles, and related documents\nto elicit underlying principles.\n▶Focus groups and workshops to gather stakeholder input for improving the usability\nof \nThe Standard for Project Management .\nAnalysis of the research led to the conclusion that more organizations are embracing a variety \nof project management approaches.

Some organizations are moving toward a hybrid approach which mixes predictive and adaptive practices. Organizations and project teams are tailoring their approaches to the needs of the industry, organization, and project. These findings indicated that the PMI standard needed to reflect a more holistic and inclusive view of project management applicable to predictive, hybrid, and adaptive approaches.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021229\nAppendix X5All of this information contributed insights to the development process for exploring:\n▶A shift from a process- to a principle-based focus that would reflect the full spectrum\nof the various ways that projects are managed.\n▶Potential new content areas for inclusion, such as benefits realization management,\norganizational change management, and complexity, in alignment with the practice guides\nin those areas.\n▶Moving any “how to” content to a more interactive and adaptive medium and adapting that\ncontent to better reflect a range of considerations based on industry, type of project, andother important characteristics.\n▶Broadening the focus of the standard to be inclusive of all projects and placing more\nemphasis on the desired outcomes from the project.\nX5.4 STANDARD DEVELOPMENT PROCESS\nDeveloping the standard included ensuring global stakeholder representation from a broad \nrange of industries and the various approaches to managing projects.\nX5.4.1  DEVELOPMENT AND REVIEW TEAMS\nPrior to developing the content for the standard, a Development Team and two review teams \nwere formed. Approximately 450 individuals applied to participate on the teams. Twelve people were selected for the Development Team and approximately 70 were selected to participate in one of two review teams. The Development Team and review teams were comprised of stakeholders from around the globe and across industry segments and roles (e.g., government, practitioners, academic, consulting, and organizational providers). The teams included expertise in delivering projects using predictive, hybrid, and adaptive approaches.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021230\nPMBOK® GuideX5.4.2  CONTENT\nThe standard is comprised of three sections: Introduction, A System for Value Delivery, and \nProject Management Principles.\nThe Introduction includes key terms and concepts associated with project management. Much \nof this information is consistent with previous editions.\nContent in the section on A System for Value Delivery draws on content from PMI foundational \nstandards2 as well as research on benefits realization management and organizational agility. The \ncontent is presented with a focus on delivering value and is inclusive of the various ways in which \nvalue is created.\nThe Project Management Principles section evolved throughout the development and validation \nprocess. The initial concepts for the principles were identified through the research discussed previously. The Development Team worked individually and collaboratively to identify potential principles and then grouped them into affinity categories. Each category was further analyzed and decomposed to include a list of keywords associated with each category. The potential categories and keywords were composed into an initial draft, which was then reviewed and commented on by the entire Development Team to ensure the intent of the principles was reflected in the draft.\nIt is important to note that the principles are intended to be broadly based. Nothing in the \nprinciples is intended to be dogmatic, restrictive, or prescriptive. The principles are aligned with, \nbut not duplicative of, the content in the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct .\nIt is not possible to generate the “right principles” as each p\nroject and organization is different. \nTherefore, the principles are designed as a guide for people working on projects. Project professionals and others working on projects can seek to be aligned with the principles, but they are not intended  \nto provide instructions for managing projects.\nX5.5 VALIDATING THE STANDARD\nContent in the standard was validated using three main approaches: global workshops, \niterative development, and public exposure draft.\n2 The Standard for Program Management – Fourth Edition and The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021231\nAppendix X5X5.5.1  GLOBAL WORKSHOPS\nThroughout the development process, global workshops were held where the move to a \nprinciple-based standard was presented and workshop participants were asked to explore guiding \nprinciples for project management. Workshops were presented in Dublin, Ireland (PMI Global Congress – EMEA); Bangalore, India; Brazilia, Brazil; Ottawa, Canada (PMI Global Executive Council meeting); Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States (PMI Global Conference); and Beijing, China. These workshops served as input into the Development Team’s work and as validation checkpoints during development.\nX5.5.2  ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT\nThe Development Team worked in pairs and small teams to develop the initial content for \neach of the three sections that comprise The Standard for Project Management . Once the initial drafts \nwere integrated, the Development Team and Review Team 1 reviewed and commented on the drafts of each section of the standard. These reviews produced over a thousand comments which the Development Team analyzed and addressed to produce a second draft of the full standard. Review Team 2 reviewed the entire draft standard and provided comments with a fresh perspective to the Development Team. Those comments were analyzed and integrated into the content, as appropriate.\nX5.5.3  EXPOSURE DRAFT\nThe draft standard was made available for public review and comment from 15 January to  \n14 February 2020. Almost 600 individuals submitted comments on the exposure draft. In response to the exposure draft comments, the content was reorganized and edited for clarity. Most comments indicated agreement with the intent of the principle-based standard. The Development Team then reviewed the draft of the standard and gave approval for the draft to go to the Standards Consensus Committee",

Industry research, global participation with broad \nindustry representation, and an iterative review process shaped and validated the move from a process-based standard to a principle-based standard. Future teams can evaluate the impact of the shift in presentation of The Standard for Project Management  and use that information to enhance or \nrevise future editions.\nPMI Seventh Edition July 2021233\nGlossary1.INCLUSIONS AND EXCLUSIONS\nThis combined glossary includes definitions of terms and acronyms from the following:\n▶The Standard for Project Management\n▶A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – Seventh Edition\nThis glossary includes terms that are:\n▶Unique or nearly unique to project management (e.g., minimum viable product, work\nbreakdown structure, Gantt chart), and\n▶Not unique to project management but used differently or with a narrower meaning\nin project management than in general everyday usage (e.g., release planning,\ncontingency reserve).\nThis glossary generally does not include:\n▶Application-area-specific terms,\n▶Terms used in project management that do not differ in any material way from everyday\nuse (e.g., calendar day, delay),\n▶Compound terms whose meanings are clear from the meanings of the component parts,\n▶Variants when the meaning of the variant is clear from the base term, and\n▶Terms that are used only once and are not critical to understanding the point of the\nsentence.
