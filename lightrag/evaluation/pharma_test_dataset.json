      "ground_truth": "In the NPP submission for Olipudase in 2019, comparability considerations addressed included the evaluation of Process B and Process C, with a focus on biochemical comparability. The FDA did not agree with the initial strategy of using Process B for the pivotal trial, as they found that the specific activity of olipudase alfa produced from Process C was consistently lower than that from Process B. Consequently, the strategy was changed to primarily utilize Process C for the pivotal trial, which was agreed upon in a meeting with the FDA in January 2017.",
