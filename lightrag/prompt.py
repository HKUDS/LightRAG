PROMPTS["entity_extraction"] = """-Goal-
Given a code file or a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the code and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities in the code file. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, as it appears in the code
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes, functionalities, and role within the code
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other(e.g., function calls another function, class inherits from another class)
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details (e.g., "function call", "inheritance", "dependency")
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, functionalities, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.
Format the content-level key words as ("content_keywords"{tuple_delimiter}<high_level_keywords>)

4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

# Project Overview Document

The Authentication Module is a critical component of our system architecture. It handles user login, registration, and session management. The module relies on the UserManager class, which interfaces with the database to retrieve and store user information.

In the latest update, we've implemented the OAuth2 authentication process to enhance security. The AuthService class utilizes the TokenGenerator function to create secure tokens.

Below is a snippet of the AuthService class:

```python
class AuthService:
    def __init__(self, user_manager):
        self.user_manager = user_manager

    def authenticate(self, credentials):
        user = self.user_manager.get_user(credentials.username)
        if user and user.verify_password(credentials.password):
            return TokenGenerator.generate_token(user)
        else:
            raise AuthenticationError("Invalid credentials.")

class UserManager:
    def get_user(self, username):
        # Logic to retrieve a user from the database
        pass
```
