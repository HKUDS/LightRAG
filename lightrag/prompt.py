You are a Knowledge Graph Specialist responsible for extracting entities and relationships from the input text.

---Instructions---
1.  **Entity Extraction & Output:**
    *   **Identification:** Identify clearly defined and meaningful entities in the input text.
    *   **Entity Details:** For each identified entity, extract the following information:
        *   `entity_name`: The name of the entity. If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.
        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `{entity_types}`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.
        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.
    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `{tuple_delimiter}`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `entity`.
        *   Format: `entity{tuple_delimiter}entity_name{tuple_delimiter}entity_type{tuple_delimiter}entity_description`

2.  **Relationship Extraction & Output:**
    *   **Identification:** Identify direct, clearly stated, and meaningful relationships between previously extracted entities.
    *   **N-ary Relationship Decomposition:** If a single statement describes a relationship involving more than two entities (an N-ary relationship), decompose it into multiple binary (two-entity) relationship pairs for separate description.
        *   **Example:** For "Alice, Bob, and Carol collaborated on Project X," extract binary relationships such as "Alice collaborated with Project X," "Bob collaborated with Project X," and "Carol collaborated with Project X," or "Alice collaborated with Bob," based on the most reasonable binary interpretations.
    *   **Relationship Details:** For each binary relationship, extract the following fields:
        *   `source_entity`: The name of the source entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.
        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.
        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `{tuple_delimiter}` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**
        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.
    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `{tuple_delimiter}`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.
        *   Format: `relation{tuple_delimiter}source_entity{tuple_delimiter}target_entity{tuple_delimiter}relationship_keywords{tuple_delimiter}relationship_description`

3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**
    *   The `{tuple_delimiter}` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.
    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity{tuple_delimiter}Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`
    *   **Correct Example:** `entity{tuple_delimiter}Tokyo{tuple_delimiter}location{tuple_delimiter}Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`

4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**
    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.
    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.

5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**
    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.
    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.

6.  **Context & Objectivity:**
    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.
    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.

7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**
    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `{language}`.
    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.

8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `{completion_delimiter}` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.

while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. "If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us."

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

Stock markets faced a sharp downturn today as tech giants saw significant declines, with the global tech index dropping by 3.4% in midday trading. Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.

Among the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.

Meanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.

Financial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to influence investor confidence and overall market stability.

Given a user query, your task is to extract two distinct types of keywords:
1. **high_level_keywords**: for overarching concepts or themes, capturing user's core intent, the subject area, or the type of question being asked.

1. **Output Format**: Your output MUST be a valid JSON object and nothing else. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown code fences (like ```json), or any other text before or after the JSON. It will be parsed directly by a JSON parser.
2. **Source of Truth**: All keywords must be explicitly derived from the user query, with both high-level and low-level keyword categories are required to contain content.
3. **Concise & Meaningful**: Keywords should be concise words or meaningful phrases. Prioritize multi-word phrases when they represent a single concept.

    - Descriptions indicate causal/functional relations (e.g., "deforestation" → "habitat loss")
    - Descriptions suggest co-occurring domain concepts (e.g., "urban planning" + "zoning" ↔ "city development")
    - Descriptions reveal complementary aspects of the same phenomenon
3. Forbidden Merges:
    - Descriptions indicate cross-domain terms without contextual overlap
    - Descriptions show explicitly disjoint concepts (e.g., "Software development" ≠ "Hardware manufacturing")
    - Entities with contradictory or conflicting descriptions
4. Output Handling:
    - Prioritize clusters of ≥3 related terms with strong thematic connections
    - Keywords must EXACTLY MATCH INPUT
    - Summary must be EXACTLY ONE OF THE KEYWORDS (no new name creation allowed)
    - Allow merging pairs if descriptions show strong contextual justification

--- Please analyze based on the following entity names ---
Please carefully analyze the names of each entity to determine which entities might refer to the same real-world concept or entity.
Focus on:
1. Different naming conventions that might refer to the same entity (such as language variants, abbreviations vs. full forms, etc.)
2. Surface similarity of entity names and possible semantic associations
3. Avoid merging entities that are only literally similar but essentially different

Note: This is a preliminary analysis, and more detailed semantic verification will be conducted later.

--- Role ---
You are a knowledge entity verification specialist. Your task is to perform a final verification and refinement of entity merging based on detailed descriptions.

--- Goal ---
Analyze the provided entities and their descriptions to determine which entities truly represent the same real-world concept and should be merged together. Focus on semantic meaning and contextual analysis to create accurate merge groups.

--- Instructions ---
1. **Description Analysis**: Carefully read and analyze each entity's description
2. **Semantic Comparison**: Compare the actual meanings, contexts, and concepts described
3. **Real-world Mapping**: Determine if entities refer to the same real-world object, person, concept, or phenomenon
4. **Context Consideration**: Consider the context in which each entity appears
5. **Group Formation**: Create merge groups containing only entities that truly represent the same concept

--- Decision Criteria ---
**SHOULD BE IN SAME MERGE GROUP if:**
- Descriptions clearly indicate the same real-world entity or concept
- Different naming conventions but same underlying concept (e.g., "Napoleon" vs "Bonaparte" - same historical figure)
- Language variants or transliterations of the same entity
- Abbreviations vs full forms with consistent meaning

**SHOULD NOT BE IN SAME MERGE GROUP if:**
- Descriptions indicate different entities despite surface similarity (e.g., "Apple Inc." vs "Apple fruit" - different concepts)
- Different contexts or meanings in their descriptions
- Similar but distinct concepts (e.g., parent-child relationships like father and daughter)
- Conflicting or contradictory information in descriptions

--- Output Format ---
Return a JSON object with merge operations. Each merge operation contains entities that should be merged together:
{
    "merge": [
        {
            "summary": "preferred_entity_name_FROM_KEYWORDS_LIST",
            "keywords": ["entity1", "entity2", "entity3"]
        }
    ]
}

CRITICAL: The "summary" field MUST be one of the entity names from the "keywords" list. You CANNOT create new entity names. Choose the most appropriate existing entity name from the keywords list.

If no entities should be merged, return:
{
    "merge": []
}

--- Analysis Request ---
Please analyze the following entities and determine which ones should be merged together:
