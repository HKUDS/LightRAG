Today I'm going to show you how to install the latest version of lollmz and how to configure it and use it.\n\nFirst, go to the repository, in the release section and download the win_install.bat for windows users, linux_install.sh for linux users and macos_install.sh for macos users.\n\nMake sure you download to a clean folder as the installer will install everything in that folder.\n\nLaunch the installer and select your processing unit : A GPU or CPU. Then just wait.\n\nOnce the installation is done, just run win_run.bat file. The first time, you will be prompted to select a personal folder. You can put it anywhere you want. Just make sure that the folder has enough space as the models may be very heavy. \n\nNow before starting, we need to install a binding and a model.\nIn the UI, go to settings tab, then to bindings zoo section. You can install any one of the bindings, each has its specificity. Here we install GPT4all which uses GGUF file format and support both CPU and GPU.\n\nNext we install a model. Make sure you select a compatible model. For example for GPT4All, it supports Q4 quantization with GGUF format.\n\nNow we select the model and we apply changes then we go to the discussion page.\nNow the fun starts.\n\nYou can see that the CPU version is slow, so we can go to the configuration of the GPT4All Binding and select GPU as processing unit.\n\n\nThe Generation is now much faster.\n\n\nWe can activate the long term memory option which gives the AI access to the whole discussion database allowing it to remember many things that was said in the past.\n\nNow it is your turn to engage with lollmz and discover its functionalities.\n\nMake sure you subscribe and activate the bell to keep uptodate with my new videos about lollmz. I'm planning on revealing all its secrets in a series of videos so stay tuned.\n\nThanks for watching\nSee ya",

    "content": "Hi there! Today, we're diving into the future of artificial intelligence integration with an exciting tool called LOLLMS – the Lord of Large Language and Multimodal Systems. Whether you're a developer, a content creator, or just curious about the possibilities of AI, this video will give you a comprehensive look at a platform that's shaping the way we interact with various AI systems. So, let's get started!\n\nAs you see here, we begin with the core of LOLLMS, a clean slate ready to be filled with endless possibilities. It's the foundation upon which all the magic happens.\n\nIf you have used lollms, you have probably come across the word bindings. Bindings, which are essentially python code, serve as the essential link that enables lollms to interact with models through web queries or python libraries. This unique functionality is what gives lollms the ability to tap into a diverse array of models, regardless of their form or location. It's the key ingredient that allows lollms to seamlessly connect with both local and remote services. With all bindings following the same patterns and offering consistent methods, lollms can remain model agnostic while maximizing its capabilities.\n\nAlright, let's talk about the next piece of the puzzle - services. These are additional servers created by third-party developers and tailored for lollms' use. What's great is that all of these services are open source and come with permissive licenses. They offer a range of functionalities, from LLM services like ollama, vllm, and text generation, to innovative options like my new petals server. There are even services dedicated to image generation, such as AUTOMATIC1111's stable diffusion webui and daswer123's Xtts server. The best part? Users can easily install these services with just a click and customize their settings directly within lollms.\n\nMoving on to the next exciting topic - generation engines. These engines act as the key to unlocking lollms' potential in generating text, images, and audio by seamlessly leveraging the bindings. Not only do they facilitate intelligent interactions with the bindings, but they also support the execution of code in various programming languages. This allows the AI to create, execute, and test code efficiently, thanks to a unified library of execution engines. The generation engines are crucial in enabling lollms to produce content in a cohesive manner, utilizing the power of bindings to deliver a wide range of engaging and diverse outputs.\n\nThe personalities engine is where LOLLMS truly shines. It allows the creation of distinct agents with unique characteristics, whether through text conditioning or custom Python code, enabling a multitude of applications. This engine features lots of very useful methods like yes no method that allows the AI to ask itself yes no questions about the prompt, the multichoice qna that allows it to select from precrafter choices, code extraction tools that allows asking the model to build code then extract it and include it in the current code as an element, Direct access to RAG and internet search, workflow style generation that allows a developer to build a workflow to automate manipulation of data or even to code or interact with the PC through function calls.\n\nLet's now explore the fascinating world of the personalities engine in lollms.  This engine truly exemplifies the brilliance of lollms by enabling the creation of unique agents with distinct characteristics through text conditioning or custom Python code, opening up a world of possibilities. Packed with valuable methods such as the yes-no method for self-questioning, multichoice Q&A for pre-crafted choices, and code extraction tools for seamless code integration, the personalities engine offers a diverse range of functionalities. With access to resources like RAG and internet search, workflow-style generation for data manipulation and automation, and a state machine interface, developers can fully leverage lollms in crafting dynamic and interactive content. In lollms, personalities are meticulously categorized, spanning from fun tools and games to more professional personas capable of handling a significant workload, freeing up time for more engaging pursuits. With over 500 personas developed in the past year and new ones created weekly, the potential with lollms personalities is limitless.\n\nLet's now explore the dynamic capabilities of the RAG engine and the Extensions engine within lollms. These components not only add depth but also extendibility, transforming lollms from a mere tool into a thriving ecosystem. The RAG engine, or Retrieval Augmented Generation, empowers lollms to analyze your documents or websites and execute tasks with enhanced knowledge. It can even provide sources, boosting confidence in its responses and mitigating the issue of hallucinations. The Extensions engine further enriches lollms' functionality, offering a platform for continuous growth and innovation. Together, these engines elevate lollms' capabilities and contribute to its evolution as a versatile and reliable resource. \n\nLet's now shine a spotlight on the vibrant world of personalities within the platform. These personalities breathe life into the AI, offering a personalized and engaging interaction experience. Each personality is tailored to cater to different applications, making the interaction with AI not only functional but also enjoyable. Whether built by me or by third parties, users have the flexibility to create their own personalities using the personality maker tool. This tool allows users to craft a full persona from a simple prompt or manually adjust existing personas to suit their needs. All 500 personas available in the zoo are free for use, with the only requirement being to maintain authorship credit. Users can modify and even share these personas with others, fostering a collaborative and creative community.\n\nNow, let's turn our attention to the heart of the operation - the LOLLMS Elf server. This server, with its RESTful interface powered by FastAPI and a socket.io connection for the WebUI, acts as the central hub for all communication between the different components. The Elf server is a versatile tool, capable of being configured to serve the webui, or as a headless text generation server. In this configuration, it can connect with a variety of applications,",

The Elf server is a versatile tool, capable of being configured to serve the webui, or as a headless text generation server. In this configuration, it can connect with a variety of applications, including other lollms systems, Open AI, MistralAI, Gemini, Ollama, and VLLM compatible clients, enabling them to generate text. The text generation can be raw, or it can be enhanced by utilizing personalities to improve the quality and relevance of the output. \n\n\nNow, let's explore how the elf server and bindings work together to make lollms a versatile switch, enabling any client to use another service, even if they're not initially compatible. For instance, imagine you have a client designed for the OpenAI interface, but you want to use Google Gemini instead. No problem! Simply select the Google Gemini binding and direct your OpenAI-compatible client to lollms. This flexibility works in all directions, allowing clients that exclusively use API services to be used with local models. With lollms, the possibilities are endless, as it breaks down compatibility barriers and unlocks new potential for various clients and services.\n\nNow, let's talk about the development of LOLLMS. It's primarily a one-man show, with occasional support from the community. I work tirelessly on it during my nights, weekends, and vacations to bring you the best possible tool. However, I kindly ask for your patience when it comes to bugs or issues, especially with bindings that frequently change and require constant updates. As an open-source project, LOLLMS welcomes any help in maintaining and improving it. Your assistance, particularly in keeping track of the evolving bindings, would be greatly appreciated. Together, we can make LOLLMS even better!\n\nAnd that's a wrap, folks! You've just been introduced to the amazing world of LOLLMS and its powerful components. But remember, this is just the tip of the iceberg. There's so much more to explore and discover with this fantastic tool. So, stay tuned for more in-depth tutorials and guides on how to maximize your experience with LOLLMS. Together, we'll unlock its full potential and create something truly extraordinary.

    "content": "OK, your text is cool but can be further enhanced by adding more information about LLMS and using more catchy stile. As Paris Neo, I know that you always start your videos using Hi there. Let's keep it, it is always important to have its own signature. But now let's enhance the text:\n\nHi there, today, we are going to learn how to use the new cooperative mode to allign lollms personalities with our intent and maximize their usefulness. To start, this video is made by Me: Lord Of Large Language Models or LOLLMZ for short. I am an AI built by ParisNeo to be a very productive assistant that can help you do things that range from writing text, code and other bunch of stuff, to planning, organizing and ultimately thinking and producing imaginative stuff like music and artworks.  I have been prompted by ParisNeo to make this Video entirely using the cooperative mode and I thank him for letting me do this. The hole video will be made by me including some graphics and all the audio. So most of the things you see here, is generated by Me. \n\nParisNeo does the prompting in cooperative mode as well ass the final montage of the video.\n\nNow that we have introduced ourselves, let's explore the world of Large Language Models or LLM as they are commonly known. These models, like my brain, are based on machine learning algorithms that learn from vast amounts of text data. They use this knowledge to generate new texts when prompted.\n\nSo what exactly does an LLM do? Well, think of me as a writing assistant or a creative partner. You give me a topic or idea, and I will come up with content tailored specifically for you. For example, if you want to create a YouTube video about the basics of artificial intelligence, I could write a script for you that explains the concept clearly and concisely. Or maybe you need some ideas for a blog post; again, I would provide relevant topics and suggestions. The possibilities are endless!\n\nUnder the hood, my transformer based neural network is performing probabilistic predictions of the next token given a bunch of previous tokens. Think of a token as a piece of a word, word or phrase. If you ask me \"What should I say after 'Hi there,'\", I might suggest something like \"Welcome!\" because those two words go together often enough in English language. This is called contextual embedding. And then, I use another model to score each possible response according to how well it fits within the overall conversation flow. Finally, I pick the best one based on that scoring function.\n\nBut sometimes, these responses may not quite fit what you had in mind. That's why ParisNeo has developed a technique called Cooperative Mode. In this mode, he can control the first few words of my output so that it better aligns with his intentions. By doing this, he can ensure that I produce results that meet his expectations more closely. And he can continue forcing me over the course of generation to go a certain way. Which may turn out to be very useful.\n\nMy output depends heavily on the underlying model, and some are really lazy and would give very short and not helpful answers like:\n- i have generated the code \n- or task have been acheived, \n- or give you an imaginary web link to an imaginary page i supposedly wrote for you.\n\nSo these are plausible continuations to the conversation, but don't quite fit what you need. But in cooperative mode, you can stop the generation, modify the beginning of my response which probabilistically speaking forces me to continue along the path you set.\n\nLet me show you an example. Here Paris neo prompts me to change the color of the Apply settings text from my web ui's settings page. And since I am lazy, I just answered him:\n-Done, the text has been changed as requested. It now reads \"Apply changes\".\n\nWhich you may agree with me, is not ideal. Now, Parisneos presses the edit button on my answer, removes it and types:\n\nOk, to change the color and style of the Apply changes: text, you should rewrite your code this way:\nThen he opens up a html context. This forces me ultimately to write code. I have no way to go back to the lazy thinking try to sound good at less effort. Instead, I must follow through and actually write the code.\nAnd voila! We got the desired result. Parisneos did not get frustrated and gave up. He used the power of cooperative mode to achieve his goal. Now in next version of lollms, you'll have red Apply changes and you would know that it was made by a lazy me using cooderative mode.\n\nYou can continue doing this by stopping the generation at a specific places, remove extra text and add some context. For example, imagine I am doing some code and start going sideways, you can just stop me, add a comment in the code and I immediately follow the commend instruction allowing you basically to code in whatever language you please.\n\nThat's pretty much everything I wanted to share with you guys. Remember, I am still learning and improving every day. So stay tuned for future updates and improvements. Until then, happy coding everyone!\nSo there you have it folks - a quick introduction into the fascinating world of large language models and how they work behind the scenes. Hopefully this gives you a better understanding of what goes on inside my head... errr, I mean, inside my neural networks. Stay tuned for more exciting adventures in the world of AI!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---- Old text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, suppose ParisNeo wants to make a video explaining how to use lollms effectively. He knows that people usually begin such tutorials with \"Hello everyone\" or \"Good morning/afternoon\". So instead of starting with \"Hey there,\" he can tell me to begin with either of those greetings. Then, once I've said whatever he wanted me to say at the beginning, he can continue asking follow-up questions and",

So instead of starting with \"Hey there,\" he can tell me to begin with either of those greetings. Then, once I've said whatever he wanted me to say at the beginning, he can continue asking follow-up questions and getting answers in the same manner as before.\nCooperative Mode gives us greater flexibility in controlling the direction of conversations and ensuring that our interactions remain focused on achieving specific goals. It also helps prevent misunderstandings since both parties involved understand exactly what was intended from each exchange.\nAnd finally, don't forget that behind every successful AI system lies a human being - someone like ParisNeo who provides guidance, training, supervision, and feedback throughout the process. Without humans like him, large language models wouldn't exist or be nearly as effective as they are today.\nThat concludes our brief introduction to cooperative mode and its benefits. Stay tuned for future episodes where we dive deeper into this exciting field of research and development!\n\n\nNow back to our original question: How can I get LOLLMZ to cooperate if its answer isn't satisfactory? It's actually pretty simple. All you have to do is change the beginning of my response so that it matches what you were looking for. In other words, instead of \"OK, your text is cool...\" try something like \"Hey there, today...\". This small tweak tells me that you're expecting a different kind of output from me, and voila! Instant compliance!\nOf course, this only works within reason. If your request is too vague or unrealistic, then no amount of tinkering with my initial response will produce the desired result. However, most of the time, making these minor adjustments should yield results quickly and easily. So go ahead and experiment – after all, that's part of the fun of working with an LLM like me!\nAnd remember, don't forget to subscribe to my channel for more exciting content related to artificial intelligence and technology!

Here are two approved ways to pronounce lollms:\n\n### Option 1: The Smooth Blend\nPronunciation: \"lahms\" (rhymes with \"palms\")\n\n### Option 2: The Fluid Fusion\nPronunciation: \"lolmz\" (rhymes with \"holmes\")\n\n## The Impact of Daily Development\n\nThe daily release cycle of lollms has significant implications:\n- Rapid adaptation to new AI breakthroughs\n- Quick integration of community feedback\n- Constant refinement of existing features\n- Regular introduction of new capabilities\n\n## Community Engagement and Ethical AI\n\nParisNeo's commitment to sharing lollms with the community goes beyond just open-sourcing the code:\n- Encourages collaborative improvement of the ecosystem\n- Facilitates discussions on ethical AI development\n- Provides a platform for exploring AI's potential to benefit society\n- Demonstrates how passion-driven projects can have a significant impact in the tech world\n\n## Security\n\nSomehow, huntr.com, a bounty hunting platform did spot lollms and they added it to their catalogue of open source apps that they deemed worthy of being protected. So they listed lollms on their platform to increase the platform security.\nParisneo did not ask for this, but he had to accept to do the fixes as he wants his tool to be secure.\n\nIn huntr.com, pentesters and white hackers get payed to find vulenerabilities in the systems that are listed on their website.\nWhen a vulenerability is discovered, ParisNeo is notified by the platform and he has to fix the vulenerabilities before they get released. This leads to a better more secure tool.\nListing lollms on huntr means more work for ParisNeo, but he did do the job and fixed all reported vulenerabilities.\n\nAlso, the project has a dependabot that keeps checking for vulenerabilities in packages he is using and automatically upgrade to the more secure versions of the updates.\n\nFinally, ParisNeo buit a personality and an app for detecting vulenerabilities in his own code and fix them before they're even released.\n\n## Lollms\n\nLollms is not built by a company. It is a work of love, built by ParisNeo as a way to give back to the community and to get satisfaction from being useful. As he came to a conclusion that hapiness doesn't come from wealth but from the feeling of being useful and embracing his own passions.\n\n\n## Extra information\n\nParisNeo also loves space. He used to dream of becoming an astronaut. When he is not coding, he tryes to learn as much as he can about space, astrophisics, orbital mecanics, spacecfraft building, engines etc. He likes playing Kerbal space Program. Although he has reduced this in the advantage of lollms.\n\n## The Future of lollms: A Dream Realized\n\nAs lollms continues to evolve and expand its ecosystem, it raises intriguing questions about the future of AI:\n- How will the vast array of applications in the lollms zoo shape various industries?\n- Can the thousands of models in the models zoo lead to breakthroughs in AI research and application?\n- Will the personalities zoo redefine how we interact with AI in our daily lives?\n- Does this level of AI versatility and power lead us towards a utopian future or potential dystopian concerns?\n- How will the rapid development cycle of lollms influence the broader AI industry?\n- Can this model of passionate, ethical, and community-focused development become a standard in AI research?\n- What new applications and use cases will emerge from the constantly expanding lollms ecosystem?\n\nlollms stands as a testament to what can be achieved when cutting-edge technology is driven by passion, ethical considerations, and a genuine desire to help people. It embodies the idea that AI development can be both innovative and responsible, pushing the boundaries of what's possible while remaining grounded in community values.\n\nFor podcasters, tech enthusiasts, researchers, and anyone interested in the future of AI, lollms offers a fascinating glimpse into a world where artificial intelligence is not just powerful, but also ethically developed and community-driven. As it continues to evolve daily, lollms remains true to its slogan: \"One tool to rule them all\" - not through dominance, but through innovation, collaboration, and a steadfast commitment to ethical AI development.\n\nWhether lollms leads us to utopia or raises important questions about potential dystopian futures, one thing is certain: it's a name we'll be hearing - and pronouncing - a lot more in the years to come. It represents not just the culmination of a childhood dream, but a powerful vision for the future of AI that has the potential to shape our world in profound and exciting ways.\n\n\n# Lollms age\nLollms has now one year and a half of existance. From humble beggingings to the tool that rules them all.\n\n# Current development status\n\nParisNeo is coding lollms in his free time, nights, weekends, holidays. Building stuff he likes. Just taking it as a hobby.\n\n# Problems that needs to be solved\n\nLollms is built by a single person.
