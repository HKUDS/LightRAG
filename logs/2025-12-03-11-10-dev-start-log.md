Actions: Fixed dev-start.sh for macOS compatibility — replaced `mapfile` bash-ism, rewrote env loading, added smart process/container detection.
Decisions: Auto-kill our own dev processes (uvicorn, vite, bun) without prompting; recognize lightrag-dev-* containers as safe; skip prompts in non-interactive mode.
Next steps: Run `make dev` to start the full stack; use `./dev-stop.sh` to stop all services.
Lessons/insights: macOS ships with Bash 3.2 which lacks `mapfile`; use while-read loops for compatibility. Check `-t 1 && -t 0` for true interactivity.
