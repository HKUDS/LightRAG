Actions:
- Added `show_configuration` function to `e2e/run_tests.sh`.
- Updated `main` function to call `show_configuration` after `print_banner`.
- Verified syntax with `--dry-run`.

Decisions:
- The configuration display is added to the normal execution flow (not just dry-run) to give immediate feedback on what settings are being used.
- It reuses the existing color constants and formatting style.

Next steps:
- None.

Lessons:
- Providing visibility into the active configuration is crucial when multiple sources (defaults, args, .env) can influence the settings.
