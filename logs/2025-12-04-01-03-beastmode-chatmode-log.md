Actions:
- Created comprehensive plan covering all upstream features/fixes in docs/diff_hku/cherry_pick_all.md.
- Updated cherry-pick plan to include top-25 and full mapping guidance and files for later per-commit processing.

Decisions:
- Opted to group by feature area rather than enumerating all 746 commits inline.

Next steps:
- Offer to generate per-commit category CSV, or to create premerge/integration branch and attempt automated cherry-pick + tests.
