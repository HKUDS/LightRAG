- Actions: Modified `lightrag/api/config.py` to set default `SUPER_ADMIN_USERS` to "admin".
- Decisions: Decided to restore "admin" as a default super user to fix 403 Forbidden errors in default/dev environments, while maintaining the ability to override it via env vars.
- Next steps: None.
- Lessons/insights: Removing hardcoded admin checks (SEC-002) requires ensuring the configuration default provides a usable fallback for dev environments.
