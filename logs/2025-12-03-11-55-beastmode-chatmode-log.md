Actions: staged and committed dev helper files (Makefile, dev-start.sh, dev-stop.sh, dev-status.sh, docker-compose.dev-db.yml, docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md); pushed branch feat/multi-tenannt to origin

Decisions: Committed the dev helper scripts and local development docs in one focused commit; left log files uncommitted

Next steps: If you'd like, open a PR or I can draft a PR description. I can also commit the log files if you want them tracked.

Lessons/insights: These helper files make local hybrid development easier (docker DBs + native API/UI). Files are pushed to origin/feat/multi-tenannt; ready for PR.
